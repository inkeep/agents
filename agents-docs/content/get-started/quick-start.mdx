<Callout type="info" title="Local Development">
The Inkeep CLI defaults to Inkeep Cloud. For local/self-hosted development, use the `--local` flag when initializing:

```bash
inkeep init --local
```

This sets up a `local` profile pointing to `localhost:3002` (Management API) and `localhost:3003` (Run API) as the default.
</Callout>
