Self-hosted Docker deployments run on the **Open Source** tier. All Open Source features are available out of the box, but several Enterprise-only capabilities require Inkeep's managed cloud infrastructure and are not available when self-hosting.

See the [pricing page](/pricing) for the full Open Source feature list.

## Infrastructure responsibilities

When self-hosting, you are responsible for:

- **Updates** — pulling and redeploying new Docker image releases
- **Scaling** — provisioning sufficient compute and managing load
- **Reliability** — uptime, backups, and incident response
- **Security** — network hardening, secrets management, and patching

There are no Inkeep-managed SLAs for self-hosted deployments.

## Upgrade to Enterprise

If your organization needs managed RAG, platform integrations, SSO, compliance certifications, or dedicated support, [schedule a demo](https://inkeep.com/demo) to learn about the Enterprise plan.
