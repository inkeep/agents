Configure email delivery so the platform can send team invitation emails and password reset links. Without email configured, these features degrade gracefully — invitation links are shown directly in the UI and password reset is disabled.

<Note>
  For a feature overview of invitations and password reset, see [Access Control](/visual-builder/access-control).
</Note>

## How It Works

The email system uses a priority-based transport selection:

| Priority | Transport | When used |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Resend** | `RESEND_API_KEY` is set |
| 2 | **Generic SMTP** | `SMTP_HOST` is set (and no Resend key) |
| 3 | **Disabled** | Neither is set — email features are turned off |

Both transports require `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` to be set. If the from address is missing, email is disabled even when a transport is configured.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` | Yes | Sender email address (e.g., `noreply@example.com`) |
| `SMTP_FROM_NAME` | No | Sender display name (e.g., `Inkeep`). Defaults to the address. |
| `SMTP_REPLY_TO` | No | Reply-to address. Defaults to the from address. |

### Option A: Resend (Recommended for Production)

[Resend](https://resend.com) provides a managed email delivery service with high deliverability.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Resend API key |

```dotenv title=".env"
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=notifications@yourdomain.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Inkeep
```

<Tip>
  When using Resend, you don't need to configure any SMTP host or port variables — the system connects to Resend's SMTP relay automatically.
</Tip>

### Option B: Generic SMTP

Use any SMTP server (Amazon SES, SendGrid, Gmail, self-hosted Postfix, etc.).

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | Yes | SMTP server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | No | Server port. Default: `587` |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | No | Use TLS/SSL. Auto-detected from port if not set (`true` for port 465). |
| `SMTP_USER` | No | SMTP authentication username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | No | SMTP authentication password |

```dotenv title=".env"
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@example.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Inkeep
```

## Local Development with Mailpit

[Mailpit](https://mailpit.axigen.com/) captures outgoing email locally without sending it to real recipients. This is the recommended setup for development and testing.

Mailpit is included in the default Docker Compose configuration. Configure the SMTP environment variables to point to it:

  <Step>
    ### Configure environment variables

    ```dotenv title=".env"
    SMTP_HOST=localhost
    SMTP_PORT=1025
    SMTP_SECURE=false
    SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@inkeep.local
    SMTP_FROM_NAME=Inkeep
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Start services and verify

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) to view the Mailpit inbox. Any emails sent by the platform (invitations, password resets) will appear here.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Without Email

When email is not configured, the platform adjusts its behavior:

| Feature | With email | Without email |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Team invitations** | Invitation email sent to the recipient | Invitation link shown directly in the UI |
| **Password reset** | Reset link emailed to the user | "Forgot password?" link hidden from the sign-in page |

No errors are thrown — the UI adapts automatically based on whether email is available.

## Verifying Email Configuration

After configuring your environment variables, restart services and test:

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Click **Invite** and send a test invitation
3. Verify the email arrives (in Mailpit for local dev, or the real inbox for production)

If using Mailpit, open [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) to see the captured email.

## Troubleshooting

### Emails not being sent

- Verify `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` is set — this is required for all transports
- Check the API server logs for `[email]` warnings about missing configuration
- For Resend: confirm your API key is valid and the from address domain is verified in Resend
- For generic SMTP: verify the host, port, and credentials are correct

### Invitation link shown instead of email

This is expected behavior when email is not configured. Set up SMTP or Resend to enable email delivery.

### "Password reset unavailable" message

The forgot-password page shows this when email is not configured. Configure email to enable self-service password resets.
