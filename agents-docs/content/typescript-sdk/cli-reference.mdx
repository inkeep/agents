## Overview

The Inkeep CLI is the primary tool for interacting with the Inkeep Agent Framework. It allows you to push Agent configurations and interact with your multi-agent system.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the CLI globally
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli

# Install the dashboard package (for visual agents orchestration)
npm install @inkeep/agents-manage-ui
```

## Global Options

All commands support the following global options:

- `--version` - Display CLI version
- `--help` - Display help for a command

## Commands

### `inkeep init`

Initialize a new Inkeep configuration file in your project.

```bash
inkeep init [path]
```

**Options:**

- `--local` - Initialize for local/self-hosted development (creates a local profile as default)
- `--no-interactive` - Skip interactive path selection
- `--config <path>` - Path to use as template for new configuration

**Cloud vs Local Initialization:**

By default, `inkeep init` runs the cloud onboarding wizard which:
- Opens browser-based authentication
- Fetches your organizations and projects from Inkeep Cloud
- Creates project directories with configuration files
- Sets up the `cloud` profile as the default in `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml`

Use `--local` for self-hosted or local development:
- Prompts for tenant ID and API URLs (defaults to `localhost:3002` and `localhost:3003`)
- Creates `inkeep.config.ts` with your local configuration
- Sets up a `local` profile as the default in `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml`
- No authentication required

**Examples:**

```bash
# Cloud initialization (default) - opens browser for auth
inkeep init

# Local/self-hosted initialization - no auth required
inkeep init --local

# Initialize in specific directory
inkeep init ./my-project

# Local init in specific directory
inkeep init --local ./my-project

# Non-interactive mode
inkeep init --no-interactive

# Use specific config as template
inkeep init --config ./template-config.ts
```

  skills="typescript-sdk"
  title="CLI inkeep push Command"
  description="Push agent configurations to your server"

### `inkeep push`

**Primary use case:** Push a project containing Agent configurations to your server. This command deploys your entire multi-agent project, including all Agents, Sub Agents, and tools.

```bash
inkeep push
```

**Options:**

- `--project <project-id>` - Project ID or path to project directory
- `--all` - Push all projects found in the current directory tree
- `--env <environment>` - Load environment-specific credentials from `environments/<environment>.env.ts`
- `--config <path>` - Override config file path (bypasses automatic config discovery)
- `--tenant-id <id>` - Override tenant ID
- `--agents-manage-api-url <url>` - Override the management API URL from config
- `--agents-run-api-url <url>` - Override agents run API URL
- `--json` - Generate project data as JSON file instead of pushing to server
- `--profile <name>` - Use a specific CLI profile (overrides the active profile)
- `--quiet` - Suppress interactive prompts and extra logs

#### Single Project Push

The most common workflow is to run `inkeep push` from inside a project directory. A project directory is identified by having an `index.ts` file that exports a project object (with `__type = "project"`).

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-project

# Push the current project
inkeep push
```

The CLI will:
1. Detect `index.ts` in the current directory
2. Load the project export from `index.ts`
3. Search upward for `inkeep.config.ts` to get tenant/API configuration
4. Push the project to the server

**Examples:**

```bash
# Push project from current directory (most common)
cd my-project && inkeep push

# Push specific project directory
inkeep push --project ./my-project

# Push all projects in current directory tree
inkeep push --all

# Push with development environment credentials
inkeep push --env development

# Generate project JSON without pushing
inkeep push --json

# Override tenant ID
inkeep push --tenant-id my-tenant

# Override API URLs
inkeep push --agents-manage-api-url https://api.example.com
inkeep push --agents-run-api-url https://run.example.com

# Use specific config file
inkeep push --config ./custom-config/inkeep.config.ts

# Use a named profile (overrides the active profile)
inkeep push --profile staging

# Quiet non-essential output for CI
inkeep push --quiet
```

#### Batch Push with `--all`

The `--all` flag discovers and pushes all projects in the current directory tree. A directory is considered a project if its `index.ts` file exports an object with `__type = "project"`.

```bash
# From a workspace root containing multiple projects
inkeep push --all
```

**Project Discovery:**

1. Searches recursively for directories containing `index.ts` files
2. Validates each `index.ts` exports a project (checks for `__type = "project"`)
3. Ensures each project can access an `inkeep.config.ts` (in the same directory or a parent directory)

**Shared Configuration:**

You can use a single `inkeep.config.ts` at the workspace root for multiple projects:

```
workspace-root/
├── inkeep.config.ts          # Shared config for all projects
└── projects/
    ├── project-a/
    │   └── index.ts          # Project A
    ├── project-b/
    │   └── index.ts          # Project B
    └── project-c/
        └── index.ts          # Project C
```

Running `inkeep push --all` from `workspace-root/` or `workspace-root/projects/` will discover and push all three projects using the shared configuration.

**Output:**

```
🚀 Batch Push: Finding all projects...

Found 3 project(s) to push:

  • project-a
  • project-b
  • project-c

[1/3] Pushing project-a...
  ✓ Project A
[2/3] Pushing project-b...
  ✓ Project B
[3/3] Pushing project-c...
  ✓ Project C

📊 Batch Push Summary:
  ✓ Succeeded: 3
```

**Environment Credentials:**

The `--env` flag loads environment-specific credentials when pushing your project. This will look for files like `environments/development.env.ts` or `environments/production.env.ts` in your project directory and load the credential configurations defined there.

**Example environment file:**

```typescript
// environments/development.env.ts
import { CredentialStoreType } from "@inkeep/agents-core";
import { registerEnvironmentSettings } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

export const development = registerEnvironmentSettings({
  credentials: {
    "api-key-dev": {
      id: "api-key-dev",
      type: CredentialStoreType.memory,
      credentialStoreId: "memory-default",
      retrievalParams: {
        key: "API_KEY_DEV",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Project Discovery and Structure

The `inkeep push` command follows this discovery process:

1. **Config File Discovery**: Searches for `inkeep.config.ts` using this pattern:

   - Starts from current working directory
   - Traverses **upward** through parent directories until found
   - Can be overridden by providing a path to the config file with the `--config` flag

2. **Workspace Structure**: Expects this directory layout:

   ```
   workspace-root/
   ├── package.json              # Workspace package.json
   ├── tsconfig.json             # Workspace TypeScript config
   ├── inkeep.config.ts          # Inkeep configuration file
   ├── my-project/               # Individual project directory
   │   ├── index.ts              # Project entry point
   │   ├── agents/               # Agent definitions
   │   │   └── *.ts
   │   ├── tools/                # Tool definitions
   │   │   └── *.ts
   │   ├── data-components/      # Data component definitions
   │   │   └── *.ts
   │   └── environments/         # Environment-specific configs
   │       ├── development.env.ts
   │       └── production.env.ts
   └── another-project/          # Additional projects
       └── index.ts
   ```

3. **Resource Compilation**: Automatically discovers and compiles:
   - All project directories containing `index.ts`
   - All TypeScript files within each project directory
   - Categorizes files by type (agents, Sub Agents, tools, data components)
   - Resolves dependencies and relationships within each project

#### Push Behavior

When pushing, the CLI:

- Finds and loads configuration from `inkeep.config.ts` at workspace root
- Discovers all project directories containing `index.ts`
- Applies environment-specific settings if `--env` is specified
- Compiles all project resources defined in each project's `index.ts`
- Validates Sub Agent relationships and tool configurations across all projects
- Deploys all projects to the management API
- Prints deployment summary with resource counts per project

<SkillRule
  id="cli-pull-command"
  skills="typescript-sdk"
  title="CLI inkeep pull Command"
  description="Pull project configuration from server and update local TypeScript files"
>

### `inkeep pull`

Pull project configuration from the server and update all TypeScript files in your local project using LLM generation.

```bash
inkeep pull
```

**Options:**

- `--project <project-id>` - Project ID to pull (or path to project directory). If in project directory, validates against local project ID.
- `--all` - Pull all projects from the server to the current directory
- `--config <path>` - Path to configuration file
- `--env <environment>` - Environment file to generate (development, staging, production). Defaults to development
- `--json` - Output project data as JSON instead of generating files
- `--debug` - Enable debug logging
- `--verbose` - Enable verbose logging
- `--force` - Force regeneration even if no changes detected
- `--introspect` - Completely regenerate all files from scratch (no comparison needed)
- `--profile <name>` - Use a specific CLI profile (overrides the active profile)
- `--quiet` - Suppress interactive prompts and extra logs

#### Single Project Pull

The most common workflow is to run `inkeep pull` from inside a project directory. A project directory is identified by having an `index.ts` file that exports a project object (with `__type = "project"`).

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-project

# Pull updates from the server
inkeep pull
```

The CLI will:
1. Detect `index.ts` in the current directory
2. Load the project export to get the project ID
3. Fetch the latest configuration from the server
4. Update your local TypeScript files with any changes

**Smart Project Detection:**

The pull command intelligently handles different scenarios:

1. **Project Directory Detection**: If your current directory contains an `index.ts` file that exports a project, the command automatically uses that project's ID
2. **Project ID Validation**: If you specify `--project` while in a project directory, it validates that the ID matches your local project
3. **Subdirectory Creation**: When not in a project directory, creates a new subdirectory named after the project ID

**`--project` Flag Behavior:**

The `--project` flag has dual functionality:
- **Directory Path**: If the value points to a directory containing `index.ts`, it uses that directory
- **Project ID**: If the value doesn't match a valid directory path, it treats it as a project ID

**Pull Modes:**

| Scenario | Command | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| In project directory | `inkeep pull` | ✅ Automatically detects project, pulls to current directory |
| In project directory | `inkeep pull --project <matching-id>` | ✅ Validates ID matches local project, pulls to current directory |
| In project directory | `inkeep pull --project <different-id>` | ❌ Error: Project ID doesn't match local project |
| Not in project directory | `inkeep pull` | ❌ Error: Requires --project flag |
| Not in project directory | `inkeep pull --project <id>` | ✅ Creates `<id>/` subdirectory with project files |

**How it Works:**

The pull command discovers and updates all TypeScript files in your project based on the latest configuration from the server:

1. **File Discovery**: Recursively finds all `.ts` files in your project (excluding `environments/` and `node_modules/`)
2. **Smart Categorization**: Categorizes files as index, agents, Sub Agents, tools, or other files
3. **Context-Aware Updates**: Updates each file with relevant context from the server:
   - **Agent files**: Updated with specific agent data
   - **Sub Agent files**: Updated with specific Sub Agent configurations
   - **Tool files**: Updated with specific tool definitions
   - **Other files**: Updated with full project context
4. **LLM Generation**: Uses AI to maintain code structure while updating with latest data

#### TypeScript Updates (Default)

By default, the pull command updates your existing TypeScript files using LLM generation:

1. **Context Preservation**: Maintains your existing code structure and patterns
2. **Selective Updates**: Only updates relevant parts based on server configuration changes
3. **File-Specific Context**: Each file type receives appropriate context (Agents get Agent data, Sub Agents get Sub Agent data, etc.)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Directory-aware pull: Automatically detects project from current directory
cd my-project  # Directory contains index.ts with project export
inkeep pull    # Pulls to current directory, no subdirectory created

# Validate project ID while in project directory
cd my-project  # Directory contains index.ts
inkeep pull --project my-project  # Validates ID matches, pulls to current directory

# Error case: Wrong project ID in project directory
cd my-project  # Directory contains index.ts with different project ID
inkeep pull --project different-project  # ERROR: Project ID mismatch

# Pull when NOT in a project directory (requires --project)
cd ~/projects
inkeep pull  # ERROR: Requires --project flag

# Pull specific project to new subdirectory
cd ~/projects
inkeep pull --project my-project  # Creates ./my-project/ subdirectory

# Save project data as JSON file instead of updating files
inkeep pull --json

# Enable debug logging
inkeep pull --debug

# Enable verbose logging
inkeep pull --verbose

# Force regeneration even if no changes detected
inkeep pull --force

# Completely regenerate all files from scratch
inkeep pull --introspect

# Generate environment-specific credentials
inkeep pull --env production

# Use specific config file
inkeep pull --config ./custom-config/inkeep.config.ts

# Pull all projects from server
inkeep pull --all

# Pull using a specific profile (overrides active)
inkeep pull --profile staging

# Quiet non-essential output for CI
inkeep pull --quiet
```

#### Batch Pull with `--all`

The `--all` flag fetches all projects from your tenant and pulls them to the current directory. Each project is created as a subdirectory.

```bash
# From a workspace directory
inkeep pull --all
```

**How it Works:**

1. Fetches all projects from the API for your tenant
2. Categorizes each project as "existing" or "new":
   - **Existing**: Directory with `index.ts` already exists → uses smart comparison mode
   - **New**: No local directory → uses introspect mode for fresh generation
3. Processes each project sequentially

**Output:**

```
🔄 Batch Pull: Sequential processing with smart comparison

  • Existing projects: Smart comparison + LLM merging + confirmation prompts
  • New projects: Fresh generation with introspect mode

Projects to pull:

  Existing (smart comparison):
    • My Agent (my-agent)
  New (introspect):
    • New Project (new-project)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[1/2] Pulling My Agent...
  ✓ My Agent → ./my-agent

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[2/2] Pulling New Project...
  ✓ New Project → ./new-project

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 Batch Pull Summary:
  ✓ Succeeded: 2
```

#### Model Configuration

The `inkeep pull` command automatically selects the best available model for LLM generation based on your API keys:

1. **Anthropic Claude** (if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set): `claude-sonnet-4-5`
2. **OpenAI GPT** (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set): `gpt-5.1`
3. **Google Gemini** (if `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` is set): `gemini-2.5-flash`

The models are used for intelligent content merging when updating modified components, ensuring your local customizations are preserved while incorporating upstream changes.

#### Validation Process

The `inkeep pull` command includes a two-stage validation process to ensure generated TypeScript files accurately represent your backend configuration:

**1. Basic File Verification**
- Checks that all expected files exist (index.ts, agent files, tool files, component files)
- Verifies file naming conventions match (kebab-case)
- Ensures project export is present in index.ts

**2. Round-Trip Validation** *(New in v0.24.0)*
- Loads the generated TypeScript using the same logic as `inkeep push`
- Serializes it back to JSON format
- Compares the serialized JSON with the original backend data
- Reports any differences found

This round-trip validation ensures:
- ✅ Generated TypeScript can be successfully loaded and imported
- ✅ The serialization logic (TS → JSON) works correctly
- ✅ Generated files will work with `inkeep push` without errors
- ✅ No data loss or corruption during the pull process

**Validation Output:**

```bash
✓ Basic file verification passed
✓ Round-trip validation passed - generated TS matches backend data
```

**If validation fails:**

The CLI will display specific differences between the generated and expected data:

```bash
✗ Round-trip validation failed

❌ Round-trip validation errors:
   The generated TypeScript does not serialize back to match the original backend data.
  • Value mismatch at agents.my-agent.name: "Original Name" vs "Generated Name"
  • Missing tool in generated: tool-id

⚠️  This indicates an issue with LLM generation or schema mappings.
The generated files may not work correctly with `inkeep push`.
```

**TypeScript generation fails:**

- Ensure your network connectivity and API endpoints are correct
- Check that your model provider credentials (if required by backend) are set up
- Try using `--json` flag as a fallback to get the raw project data

**Validation errors during pull:**

- The generated TypeScript may have syntax errors or missing dependencies
- Check the generated file manually for obvious issues
- Try pulling as JSON first to verify the source data: `inkeep pull --json`
- If round-trip validation fails, report the issue with the error details

  id="cli-profile-command"
  skills="typescript-sdk"
  title="CLI inkeep profile Command"
  description="Manage named CLI profiles for multiple remotes, credentials, and environments"
>

### `inkeep profile`

Manage named CLI profiles for multiple remotes, credentials, and environments. Profiles are stored in `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml`. A default `cloud` profile points to hosted endpoints.

```yaml
# ~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml
activeProfile: cloud
profiles:
  cloud:
    remote: cloud
    credential: inkeep-cloud
    environment: production
  local:
    remote:
      manageApi: http://localhost:3002
      manageUi: http://localhost:3000
      runApi: http://localhost:3003
    credential: inkeep-local
    environment: development
```

**Subcommands:**

- `inkeep profile list` — Show all profiles and the active one.
- `inkeep profile add <name>` — Interactive creation for cloud or custom URLs; writes to `profiles.yaml`.
- `inkeep profile use <name>` — Switch the active profile.
- `inkeep profile current` — Show the active profile details and credential key.
- `inkeep profile remove <name>` — Delete a profile (cannot remove the active one).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a local profile and switch to it
inkeep profile add local
inkeep profile use local

# Inspect which profile is active
inkeep profile current

# List all profiles
inkeep profile list

# Remove an unused profile
inkeep profile remove staging
```

**How profiles are used:**

- `inkeep login --profile <name>` stores credentials under the profile’s credential key.
- Commands that talk to the APIs (`push`, `pull`, `status`, `login`, `logout`) honor `--profile <name>`; if omitted, the active profile is used.
- Each profile bundles remote URLs, an environment name, and a credential reference so you can move between cloud and self-hosted deployments without editing config files.

#### Using profiles with authenticated deployments

If your deployment requires authentication (cloud or self-hosted), run `inkeep login` for each profile so its credential slot in `profiles.yaml` has a token in the system keychain:

```bash
# Authenticate against your secured deployment
inkeep login --profile local

# Validate which profile is active before running commands
inkeep profile current

# Use the profile when pushing/pulling
inkeep push --profile local
inkeep pull --profile local
```

- The `credential` field in the profile is the key used to store the token; `login` writes to that key and `push/pull/status` read from it.
- Repeat `login --profile <name>` for every profile/remote you operate against.
- Use `inkeep logout --profile <name>` to clear a profile’s stored credentials if you need to rotate access.

>

### `inkeep add`

Pull a template project or MCP from the [Inkeep Agents Cookbook](https://github.com/inkeep/agents/tree/main/agents-cookbook).

```bash
inkeep add [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--project <name>` - Add a project template
- `--mcp <name>` - Add a custom MCP server template for common use cases (adds server code to your project)
- `--ui [component-id]` - Add a data or artifact UI component to your app (writes to `apps/agents-ui/src/ui` by default). Use the component id from the dashboard. Omit the id to see available components.
- `--ui --list` - List available data and artifact components that have render code (same ids as in the dashboard “Use in your app” flow).
- `--target-path <path>` - Target path to add the template to
- `--config <path>` - Path to configuration file
- `--profile <name>` - Profile to use for auth (with `--ui`)
- `--quiet` - Suppress non-essential output (with `--ui`)

**Examples:**

```bash
# List available templates (both project and MCP)
inkeep add

# Add a project template
inkeep add --project activities-planner

# Add project template to specific path
inkeep add --project activities-planner --target-path ./examples

# Add a custom MCP server template (auto-detects apps/mcp/app directory)
inkeep add --mcp zendesk

# Add MCP server template to specific path
inkeep add --mcp zendesk --target-path ./apps/mcp/app

# Using specific config file
inkeep add --project activities-planner --config ./my-config.ts

# List addable UI components (data/artifact components with render code)
inkeep add --ui --list

# Add a single UI component by id (id from dashboard)
inkeep add --ui weather-forecast
```

**Behavior:**

- When adding an MCP server template without `--target-path`, the CLI automatically searches for an `apps/mcp/app` directory in your project
- If no app directory is found, you'll be prompted to confirm whether to add to the current directory
- Project templates are added to the current directory or specified `--target-path`
- Model configurations are automatically injected based on available API keys in your environment (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`)
- For `--ui`: requires authentication (same as push/pull). The component file is written with an export ensured on the main component. Register the component in your chat widget with the dashboard component **name** as the key and your imported component as the value (e.g. `components: { "Weather Forecast": WeatherForecast }`).

### `inkeep update`

Update the Inkeep CLI to the latest version from npm.

```bash
inkeep update
```

**Options:**

- `--check` - Check for updates without installing
- `--force` - Force update even if already on latest version

**How it Works:**

The update command automatically:

1. **Detects Package Manager**: Identifies which package manager (npm, pnpm, bun, or yarn) was used to install the CLI globally
2. **Checks Version**: Compares your current version with the latest available on npm
3. **Updates CLI**: Executes the appropriate update command for your package manager
4. **Displays Changelog**: Shows a link to the changelog for release notes

**Examples:**

```bash
# Check if an update is available (no installation)
inkeep update --check

# Update to latest version (with confirmation prompt)
inkeep update

inkeep update --force
```

**Output Example:**

```
📦 Version Information:
  • Current version: 0.22.3
  • Latest version:  0.23.0

📖 Changelog:
  • https://github.com/inkeep/agents/blob/main/agents-cli/CHANGELOG.md

🔍 Detected package manager: pnpm

✅ Updated to version 0.23.0
```

**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter permission errors, try running with elevated permissions:

```bash
# For npm, pnpm, yarn
sudo inkeep update

# For bun
sudo -E bun add -g @inkeep/agents-cli@latest
```

**Package Manager Detection:**

The CLI automatically detects which package manager you used by checking global package installations:
- npm: Checks `npm list -g @inkeep/agents-cli`
- pnpm: Checks `pnpm list -g @inkeep/agents-cli`
- bun: Checks `bun pm ls -g`
- yarn: Checks `yarn global list`

If automatic detection fails, the CLI will prompt you to select your package manager.

>

## Configuration File

The CLI uses a configuration file (typically `inkeep.config.ts`) to store settings:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@inkeep/agents-cli/config";

export default defineConfig({
  tenantId: "your-tenant-id",
  agentsManageApiUrl: "http://localhost:3002",
  agentsRunApiUrl: "http://localhost:3003",
});
```

### Configuration Priority

Effective resolution order:

1. Command-line flags (highest)
2. Environment variables (override config values)
3. `inkeep.config.ts` values

  skills="typescript-sdk"
  title="CLI Environment Variables"
  description="Environment variables respected by the CLI and SDK"
>

## Environment Variables

The CLI and SDK respect the following environment variables:

- `INKEEP_TENANT_ID` - Tenant identifier
- `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_URL` - Management API base URL
- `INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_URL` - Run API base URL
- `INKEEP_ENV` - Environment name for credentials loading during `inkeep push`
- `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_BYPASS_SECRET` - Optional bearer for Manage API (advanced)
- `INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_BYPASS_SECRET` - Optional bearer for Run API (advanced)

</SkillRule>

## Troubleshooting

**Project Not Found:**

- Projects are automatically managed based on your tenantId
- `inkeep push` will create resources as needed
