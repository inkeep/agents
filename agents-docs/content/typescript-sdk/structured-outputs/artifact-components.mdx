## Defining Artifact Components

Artifact components are defined using the `artifactComponent` builder function. **We recommend using Zod schemas** for type safety and better developer experience.

<Callout>
  **Quick Start**: Citation artifacts are automatically included when you create
  a new project with `npx @inkeep/create-agents`, providing a ready-to-use
  example.
</Callout>

```typescript
import { artifactComponent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
import { z } from "zod";
import { preview } from "@inkeep/agents-core";

export const citation = artifactComponent({
  id: "citation",
  name: "citation",
  description: "Structured factual information extracted from search results",
  props: z.object({
    title: preview(z.string().describe("Title of the source document")),
    url: preview(z.string().describe("URL of the source document")),
    record_type: preview(
      z.string().describe("Type of record (documentation, blog, guide, etc.)")
    ),
    content: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          type: z
            .string()
            .describe("Type of content (text, image, video, etc.)"),
          text: z.string().describe("The actual text content"),
        })
      )
      .describe(
        "Array of structured content blocks extracted from the document"
      ),
  }),
});
```

<Callout>
  JSON Schema is also supported. Set `inPreview: true` on properties instead of
  using `preview()`.
</Callout>

## Schema Requirements

<Callout type="warning">
  **Critical**: Artifact schemas must match your tool's output structure. The
  system uses JMESPath selectors on JSON - it **cannot extract from free text**.
</Callout>

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Tool returns text, schema expects structured data
// Tool output: { result: { content: [{ text: "Weather: Sunny, 75°F" }] } }
props: z.object({
  temperature: z.number(), // ❌ Cannot extract number from text
  condition: z.string(), // ❌ Cannot extract condition from text
});

// ✅ CORRECT: Tool returns structured data matching schema
// Tool output: { result: { temperature: 75, condition: "Sunny" } }
props: z.object({
  temperature: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
});
```

Use OpenTelemetry traces to debug schema validation issues.

## Preview Fields

Use `preview()` to mark fields for immediate availability. The `preview()` helper automatically sets `inPreview: true` in the generated schema.

**Preview fields are:**

- Included in the agent's context when an artifact is referenced, so the agent can reason about them directly
- Shown to other agents in the project for cross-agent reasoning
- Streamed in real-time to clients (Vercel AI SDK)
- Auto-rendered by Inkeep's widget (citations as interactive cards)
- Available immediately in UI (full artifact loads on-demand)

**Non-preview fields** are persisted in storage but kept out of the agent's working context by default, keeping the context window lean. Agents can retrieve the complete artifact — including all non-preview fields — on demand when they need it.

**No schema?** Omit `props` to save the entire tool result without filtering.

## Accessing Artifact Data

Agents can access artifact data in a few ways:

- **In context** — after creating or referencing an artifact, the agent can see its preview fields directly in its working context
- **Passing to a tool** — the agent can supply an artifact as an argument to a tool; the tool receives the complete artifact data, including all non-preview fields
- **On-demand retrieval** — the agent can explicitly fetch the full artifact when it needs to read non-preview fields itself

## Passing Artifacts to Tools

When an agent passes an artifact to a tool as an argument, the tool receives the **complete artifact data** — all fields, including those not marked `inPreview`. This means you can design tools that work with rich artifact content without needing to fetch or reconstruct data manually.

For example, a document processing tool can access the full `content` array from a citation artifact even though `content` is a non-preview field:

```typescript
import { tool } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

const summarizeTool = tool({
  id: "summarize-document",
  description: "Summarize the content of a document artifact",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    // The agent passes an artifact here; the tool receives all fields
    document: z.object({
      title: z.string(),
      url: z.string(),
      content: z.array(z.object({ type: z.string(), text: z.string() })),
    }),
  }),
  execute: async ({ document }) => {
    // document.content is fully available here, even though it's non-preview
    const fullText = document.content.map((c) => c.text).join("\n");
    return { summary: fullText.slice(0, 500) };
  },
});
```

## Artifact Creation

When an agent uses a tool:

1. The tool processes the request and returns a response
2. **The agent decides** whether to create an artifact from the tool response
3. If created, the artifact is parsed according to the artifact component schema
4. The artifact can be associated with any data components that reference this information

## Artifacts vs Data Components

**Artifacts** and **Data Components** are different:

- **Artifacts**: Citations/sources from tool results stored in the database
- **Data Components**: UI elements agents output in responses (Text, Fact, etc.)

Artifacts provide the source citations that back up information in data components.

## Using in Agents

After defining your artifact component, use it in an agent:

```typescript
import { agent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
import { citation } from "./artifact-components/citation";

const searchAgent = agent({
  id: "search-agent",
  canUse: () => [searchTool],
  prompt: "Search for information and cite sources using artifacts.",
  artifactComponents: () => [citation],
});
```

## Citation Artifacts

Citation artifacts that are named `citation` and have `title` and `url` preview fields are automatically rendered as interactive cards by Inkeep's widget library. This provides source attribution and allows users to verify information at the source.

<Image
  src="/images/citation-widget-example.png"
  alt="Citation artifact rendered as an interactive card in the Inkeep widget showing source attribution"
  style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}
/>

## Example Flow

Here's a complete example with inline artifact component definition:

```typescript
import { agent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
import { z } from "zod";
import { preview } from "@inkeep/agents-core";

const searchAgent = subAgent({
  id: "search",
  canUse: () => [searchTool],
  prompt: "Search for information and cite sources using artifacts.",
  artifactComponents: [
    {
      id: "citation",
      name: "citation",
      description: "Search result document",
      props: z.object({
        title: preview(z.string().describe("Document title")),
        url: preview(z.string().describe("Document URL")),
        content: z.string().describe("Document content"),
      }),
    },
  ],
});
```

## No Schema Example

```typescript
const rawDataAgent = subAgent({
  id: "raw-data",
  canUse: () => [apiTool],
  prompt: "Fetch data and save complete responses.",
  artifactComponents: [
    {
      id: "api-response",
      name: "API Response",
      description: "Complete API response data",
      // No props - saves entire tool result
    },
  ],
});
```

Example flow:

1. Agent uses search tool and gets results
2. **Agent decides** to create an artifact citing the source document
3. Artifact is stored with preview fields (title, url) shown to other agents
4. Other agents can reference this artifact or get full content when needed
