## Overview

Skills are reusable instruction blocks that you can attach to multiple sub-agents. They help you keep shared rules,
tone, and formatting consistent across the agent graph while still allowing each sub-agent to focus on its own role.

## Create a skill

1. Go to **Skills** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create skill**.
3. Fill in the required fields and save.

## Fields

- **Name**: Human-friendly label shown in the UI.
- **Id**: Unique identifier used by agents and attachments.
- **Description**: Short summary used for search and discovery.
- **Content**: Markdown instructions injected into the system prompt.
- **Metadata (JSON)**: Optional structured data for custom workflows.

## Attach skills to sub-agents

Open an agent in the Visual Builder, select a sub-agent node, and use the **Skills** picker to attach one or more
skills. You can drag to reorder them and control their priority.
