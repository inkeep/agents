## Overview

Skills are reusable instruction blocks that you can attach to multiple sub-agents. They help you keep shared rules,
tone, and formatting consistent across the agent graph while still allowing each sub-agent to focus on its own role.

## Create a skill

1. Go to **Skills** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create skill**.
3. Fill in the required fields and save.

## Fields

- [**Name**](https://agentskills.io/specification#name-field): A short identifier.
- [**Description**](https://agentskills.io/specification#description-field): When to use this skill.
- [**Content**](https://agentskills.io/specification#body-content): The Markdown body, write whatever helps agents perform the task effectively.
- [**Metadata (JSON)**](https://agentskills.io/specification#metadata-field): Additional properties not defined by [the Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/home).

## Attach skills to sub-agents

Open an agent in the Visual Builder, select a sub-agent node, and use the **Skills** picker to attach one or more
skills.

## Always loaded and On-demand skills

Use **Always loaded** to include a skill in every prompt. It's off by default so skills load on demand unless you
enable it.

On-demand skills appear as an outline in the system prompt and can be loaded when needed via the built-in
`load_skill` tool.
