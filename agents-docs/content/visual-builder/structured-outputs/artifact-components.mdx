<Callout>
  **Quick Start**: Citation artifacts are automatically included when you create
  a new project with `npx @inkeep/create-agents`. You'll find the complete
  implementation in `artifact-components/citation.ts` in your project. They
  provide a ready-to-use example for source attribution (for example, when
  citing webpages) and are automatically rendered by the Inkeep widget with
  professional styling and interactions.
</Callout>

## How to create an artifact component

1. Go to the Artifact Components tab in the left sidebar. Then select "New artifact component".
2. Add in an id, name, and description. These are required fields.
3. For the props schema, you can either:
   - **Enter a JSON schema** with `inPreview: true` properties to define specific fields that will be immediately available
   - **Leave empty** to save the entire tool result without filtering
4. Click "Submit".

To visually add the artifact component to the Agent, see the [Sub Agents](/visual-builder/sub-agents#adding-artifact-components) page for details.

## Schema Requirements

<Callout type="warning">
  **Critical**: Your artifact schema must match your tool's output structure.
  The system uses JMESPath selectors on JSON - it **cannot extract from free
  text**.
</Callout>

```json
// ❌ WRONG: Tool returns text, schema expects structured data
// Tool output: { "result": { "content": [{ "text": "Weather: Sunny, 75°F" }] } }
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "temperature": { "type": "number" }, // ❌ Cannot extract number from text
    "condition": { "type": "string" }     // ❌ Cannot extract condition from text
  }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Tool returns structured data matching schema
// Tool output: { "result": { "temperature": 75, "condition": "Sunny" } }
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "temperature": { "type": "number" },
    "condition": { "type": "string" }
  }
}
```

Use OpenTelemetry traces to debug schema validation issues.

### Preview Fields

Set `inPreview: true` on properties for immediate availability. These fields are:

- Included in the agent's context when an artifact is referenced, so the agent can reason about them directly
- Shown to other agents in the project for cross-agent reasoning
- Streamed in real-time to clients (Vercel AI SDK)
- Auto-rendered by Inkeep's widget (citations as interactive cards)
- Available immediately in UI (full artifact loads on-demand)

Fields **without** `inPreview: true` are persisted in storage but kept out of the agent's working context by default, keeping the context window lean. Agents can retrieve the complete artifact — including all non-preview fields — on demand when they need it.

For more details on how artifact data is streamed via the API, see [Data Artifact Events](/typescript-sdk/data-operations#artifact-events).

**Example:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "description": "Title of the source document",
      "type": "string",
      "inPreview": true
    },
    "url": {
      "description": "URL of the source document",
      "type": "string",
      "inPreview": true
    },
    "record_type": {
      "description": "Type of record (documentation, blog, guide, etc.)",
      "type": "string",
      "inPreview": true
    },
    "content": {
      "description": "Array of structured content blocks extracted from the document",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "type": {
            "description": "Type of content (text, image, video, etc.)",
            "type": "string"
          },
          "text": {
            "description": "The actual text content",
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "required": ["type", "text"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "url", "content", "record_type"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Accessing Artifact Data

Agents can access artifact data in a few ways:

- **In context** — after creating or referencing an artifact, the agent can see its preview fields directly in its working context
- **Passing to a tool** — the agent can supply an artifact as an argument to a tool; the tool receives the complete artifact data, including all non-preview fields
- **On-demand retrieval** — the agent can explicitly fetch the full artifact when it needs to read non-preview fields itself

Not every intermediate tool result needs to become an artifact. When an agent chains tool calls — passing one tool's output directly into the next — no artifact is created and nothing surfaces to the user.

## Passing Artifacts to Tools

When a tool receives an artifact as an argument, it has access to all fields — not just the preview ones. For example, a document processing tool can read the full `content` array even though `content` is a non-preview field:

```typescript
import { functionTool } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const summarizeTool = functionTool({
  id: "summarize-document",
  description: "Summarize the content of a document artifact",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      // The agent passes an artifact here; the tool receives all fields
      document: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          title: { type: "string" },
          url: { type: "string" },
          content: {
            type: "array",
            items: {
              type: "object",
              properties: {
                type: { type: "string" },
                text: { type: "string" },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  execute: async ({ document }) => {
    // document.content is fully available here, even though it's non-preview
    const fullText = document.content.map((c) => c.text).join("\n");
    return { summary: fullText.slice(0, 500) };
  },
});
```

Citation artifacts that are named `citation` and have `title` and `url` preview fields are auto-rendered by Inkeep's widget in two ways:

- **Inline footnotes**: Numbered references [1], [2], etc. appear inline with the response text
- **Interactive cards**: Source cards with title, URL, and content appear below the response for detailed exploration

<Callout>
  **Important**: The artifact must have a name of `citation` in order to be
  auto-rendered by Inkeep's widget.
</Callout>

  style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}

## Artifact Name & Description Generation

**Important**: Artifact names and descriptions are automatically generated at the **agent level** using that specific agent's configured **summarizer model**.

### How It Works

When an agent creates an artifact during tool execution or data processing:

1. **Agent Creates Artifact**: During tool execution or data processing
2. **Summarizer Analysis**: The agent's summarizer model analyzes:
   - The artifact content and structure
   - Recent conversation context
   - The user's original question or request
3. **Name Generation**: Creates a concise, descriptive name (max 50 characters)
4. **Description Generation**: Provides context about relevance and content (max 150 characters)

### Model Settings for Artifacts

Each agent uses its configured summarizer model for artifact generation:

```typescript
// Agent with custom summarizer for artifact generation
const researchAgent = subAgent({
  id: "research-agent",
  name: "Research Agent",
  prompt:
    "You are a research agent that can generate artifact names and descriptions",
  models: {
    base: { model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0" },
    summarizer: {
      model: "openai/gpt-4.1-mini", // This model generates artifact names/descriptions
      providerOptions: {
        temperature: 0.2, // Lower temperature for consistent naming
        maxOutputTokens: 512,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Inheritance and Fallback

Artifact generation follows the same model inheritance rules:

- **Default**: Sub Agent uses the Agent's summarizer model (if configured)
- **Fallback**: If no summarizer configured at project/agent level, falls back to Sub Agent's base model
- **Override**: Agent can specify its own summarizer model

### Best Practices

- **Consistent Models**: Use the same summarizer model across related agents for consistent artifact naming
- **Appropriate Models**: Choose models good at summarization (GPT-4o-mini, claude-3.5-haiku work well)
- **Temperature Settings**: Lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) provide more consistent naming patterns
