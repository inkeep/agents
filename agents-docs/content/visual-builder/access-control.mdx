The Inkeep Agent Framework provides two layers of access control:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **Authentication** | Users sign in, belong to organizations, manage teams |
| **Authorization** | Fine-grained project-level roles and permissions |

Authentication handles user sign-in and organization membership. Authorization adds granular control over who can do what within each project.

<Note>
  For deployment configuration including OAuth providers, see [Authentication Setup](/deployment/authentication).
</Note>

## Sign-In Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Email & Password** | Default sign-in with email and password credentials |
| **Google** | OAuth sign-in (requires configuration) |

To add Google sign-in, see [Adding OAuth Providers](/deployment/authentication#google-oauth).

## Organizations & Team Management

Each organization operates as an isolated tenant:

- **Separate workspaces**: Each organization has its own projects, agents, MCP servers, and credentials
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple users can belong to the same organization
- **Role-based access**: Team members have different permission levels

### Organization Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | All Admin permissions, plus protection from role changes by Admins. Only other Owners can change an Owner's role |
| **Admin** | Full access to all projects and settings, can manage members and roles |
| **Member** | Access determined by project-level roles |

Organization creators are automatically assigned the Owner role.

### Managing Team Members

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. View current members and their roles
3. Click **Add** to add new team members
4. Select a role (Admin or Member) for the new team member

## Project Roles & Permissions

Assign granular roles at the project level to give organization Members specific access to individual projects.

### Role Hierarchy

| Role | View | Use | Edit |
|------|:----:|:---:|:----:|
| **Project Admin** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Project Member** | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| **Project Viewer** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

### Permission Breakdown

| Permission | What it allows |
|------------|----------------|
| **View** | See project configuration, agents, and settings (read-only) |
| **Use** | Invoke agents, create API keys, view traces |
| **Edit** | Modify agents, tools, credentials, project settings, and evaluations (datasets, evaluators, configs) |

### Managing Project Members

1. Navigate to your project
2. Go to **Members**
3. Search for members by email and select one or more to add
4. Choose a role for the selected members and click **Add**

<Tip>
  Organization Owners and Admins always have full access to all projects, regardless of project-level roles.
</Tip>

## User-Scoped vs Project-Scoped Resources

Certain resources can be configured with different scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Project-scoped** | Shared across all users in the project |
| **User-scoped** | Configured separately for each user |

### Example: MCP Servers

MCP servers can be configured as either project-scoped or user-scoped:

| Use Case | Recommended Scope |
|----------|-------------------|
| Shared company tools (internal APIs, databases) | Project-scoped |
| Personal integrations (user's Slack, GitHub, email) | User-scoped |
| Services requiring per-user authorization | User-scoped |
| Tools where data should be separated by user | User-scoped |

<Tip>
  You only configure a user-scoped MCP server once. Each user sees the same server but connects with their own credentials. The framework automatically manages the per-user authentication.
</Tip>

To select the scope, go to **MCP Servers** → create a server → select the scope.

See [MCP Servers](/visual-builder/tools/mcp-servers) for more details.
