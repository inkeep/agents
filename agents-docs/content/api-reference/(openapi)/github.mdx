      - content: >-
          Generates a URL to install the GitHub App on an organization or user
          account. The URL includes a signed state parameter that encodes the
          tenant ID and expires after 10 minutes. After installation, GitHub
          will redirect back to our callback endpoint with this state.
        heading: get-github-app-installation-url
      - content: >-
          Returns a list of GitHub App installations connected to this tenant.
          By default, deleted installations are filtered out. Use the
          includeDisconnected query parameter to include them.
        heading: list-github-app-installations
      - content: >-
          Returns detailed information about a specific GitHub App installation,
          including the full list of repositories.
        heading: get-github-app-installation-details
      - content: >-
          Permanently deletes a GitHub App installation from the tenant. This
          hard deletes the installation record, all associated repositories, and
          project repository access entries. This action cannot be undone. Use
          POST /disconnect for soft delete instead. Note: This does NOT
          uninstall the GitHub App from GitHub - the user can do that separately
          from GitHub settings.
        heading: delete-a-github-app-installation-permanently
      - content: >-
          Disconnects a GitHub App installation from the tenant. This soft
          deletes the installation (sets status to "disconnected") and removes
          all project repository access entries. The installation record is
          preserved for audit purposes. Note: This does NOT uninstall the GitHub
          App from GitHub - the user can do that separately from GitHub
          settings.
        heading: disconnect-a-github-app-installation
      - content: >-
          Reconnects a previously disconnected GitHub App installation by
          setting its status back to "active" and syncing the available
          repositories from GitHub. This can only be used on installations with
          "disconnected" status.
        heading: reconnect-a-disconnected-github-app-installation
      - content: >-
          Manually refreshes the repository list for a GitHub App installation
          by fetching the current list from GitHub API. This is useful if
          webhooks were missed or to ensure the local data is in sync with
          GitHub.
