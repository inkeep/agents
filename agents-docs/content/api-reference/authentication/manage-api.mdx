The Management API routes (`agents-api` routes under `/manage`) require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Authentication is attempted in the following priority order:

<Note>
    To disable authentication for local development, set `DISABLE_AUTH=true` or `ENVIRONMENT=test` in your .env file.
</Note>

## 1. Bypass Secret

When `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_BYPASS_SECRET` is set, you can use this secret as the Bearer token for full access.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_BYPASS_SECRET" \
  https://your-api/manage/...
```

Useful for admin access and CI/CD pipelines.

## 2. Session Token

If you've authenticated via the device authorization flow (e.g., through the CLI or SDK), your session token can be used.

Session cookies are also supported via the `cookie` header or `x-forwarded-cookie` header (for MCP/SDK calls).

## 3. Database API Key

API keys stored in the database can be used for authentication. These keys are associated with a specific tenant.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ink_your_api_key" \
  https://your-api/manage/...
```

## 4. Internal Service Token

For service-to-service communication within the Inkeep platform, internal service tokens (JWTs) are supported. These tokens can include tenant and project scope.

<Note>
All requests must include a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. If no authentication method succeeds, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.
