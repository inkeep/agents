Enable your team to interact with Inkeep Agents directly from Slack using slash commands and @mentions.

## Features

- **Slash commands** - `/inkeep [question]` for private, ephemeral responses
- **@mentions** - `@Inkeep [question]` for public, threaded responses
- **Multi-turn conversations** - Continue conversations with the Follow Up button
- **Agent configuration** - Set default agents per workspace or channel
- **Account linking** - Connect Slack identities to Inkeep for personalized responses

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the Slack app

    Navigate to **Work Apps → Slack** in the dashboard and click **Install to Slack**. Complete the OAuth flow to authorize the app in your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure the default agent

    After installation, select a default agent for your workspace. This agent handles all requests unless overridden at the channel level.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Link user accounts (optional)

    Users can link their Slack account to Inkeep by running `/inkeep link` in Slack and clicking the generated link. This enables personalized responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Slash commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/inkeep [question]` | Ask the default agent (ephemeral response) |
| `/inkeep` | Open the agent picker modal |
| `/inkeep help` | Show available commands |
| `/inkeep link` | Link your Slack account to Inkeep |
| `/inkeep status` | Check your link status and active agent |
| `/inkeep run "agent" [question]` | Ask a specific agent by name |

Slash command responses are **ephemeral** - only visible to you.

## @Mentions

Mention `@Inkeep` in any channel to get a public response in a thread:

```
@Inkeep How do I configure authentication?
```

The response streams in real-time and is visible to everyone in the channel. Reply in the thread to continue the conversation.

## Agent configuration

### Workspace default

Set a default agent for the entire workspace in the dashboard. This agent handles all requests unless a channel-specific default is configured.

### Channel defaults

Override the workspace default for specific channels. Navigate to **Work Apps → Slack → Channels** in the dashboard to configure channel-level agents.

Agent resolution priority: **Channel default → Workspace default**
