# Install and Set Up the GitHub App

This guide is for **organization administrators**. It walks you through installing the Inkeep GitHub App, connecting your repositories, and setting up access for your agents.

<Note>
The GitHub integration is a **cloud-only** feature. On Inkeep Cloud, all required environment variables are pre-configured — you don't need to set anything up on the infrastructure side.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- An Inkeep Cloud account with at least one project configured
- **GitHub organization admin** access (or user account owner for personal repositories)

## Install the app

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Work Apps dashboard

    Navigate to your Inkeep dashboard and select **Work Apps** from the sidebar. You'll see the GitHub integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install to GitHub

    Click **Install** on the GitHub card. This redirects you to GitHub's authorization screen where you select which organization or user account to install the app on.

    The app requests the following permissions:
    - Read access to repository contents and metadata
    - Write access to create branches, commits, and pull requests
    - Read and write access to issues and comments
    - Access to organization/account information
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Select repositories

    Choose whether to give the app access to all repositories or select specific ones. You can change this later in GitHub's app settings.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the installation

    After authorizing, you're redirected back to the dashboard. The GitHub card shows your installation as **Active** with the organization or account name.

    You should see your repositories listed in the installation details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure repository access

After installing, configure which repositories your agents can access. See the full [Configuration guide](/talk-to-your-agents/github/configuration) for details.

**Quick overview:**

- By default, new installations give all projects access to all synced repositories
- You can restrict access at the project level (all repos vs. specific repos)
- You can further restrict access at the MCP tool level

## Managing installations

### Sync repositories

If you add or remove repositories from the GitHub App in GitHub's settings, click **Sync** in the Inkeep dashboard to refresh the repository list.

### Disconnect vs. Delete

- **Disconnect** — Soft-deletes the installation. The record is preserved, and you can reconnect later.
- **Delete** — Permanently removes the installation and all associated repository access. This cannot be undone.

<Warning>
Disconnecting or deleting from Inkeep does **not** uninstall the GitHub App from GitHub. To fully remove the integration, also uninstall the app from GitHub's settings.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Installation link expired

The installation link expires after 10 minutes. If you see an error, return to the dashboard and click **Install** again.

### Missing repositories

If repositories aren't showing up:

1. Check the GitHub App settings to ensure the app has access
2. Click **Sync** in the Inkeep dashboard
3. Verify the repositories aren't private with restricted visibility settings
