# Local Development with Slack

The `setup-slack-dev` script creates a personal Slack app and wires up all the credentials you need to run the Slack integration locally. It uses **Socket Mode**, so you don't need ngrok or any other tunneling tool — events arrive over a WebSocket connection directly to your machine.

<Note>
This is a **developer-only** setup. For production or team-wide Slack installation, see the [Installation guide](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/installation).
</Note>

## Why each developer needs their own app

Socket Mode distributes incoming Slack events to one connected client at a time (round-robin), not to all listeners simultaneously. If multiple developers shared a single app, only one of them would receive any given event. A personal dev app ensures you reliably receive the events you're testing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and `pnpm` installed
- Access to the Inkeep repository with the Slack integration code
- A Slack account with permission to create apps in your workspace

## Run the setup script

```bash
pnpm setup-slack-dev
```

The script is fully automated. **The first run** requires two manual steps — pasting a config refresh token and an app-level token. **Subsequent runs** are zero-paste: the script refreshes credentials automatically using the saved configuration.

## First-run walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Generate a unique dev identifier

    The script generates a random name suffix (e.g., `frost-ember`) and creates your app as **"Inkeep Dev frost-ember"**. Random naming prevents collisions when multiple developers are working simultaneously.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Obtain a Slack configuration token

    The script opens a URL for you to log in to your Slack account and retrieve a **configuration refresh token**. Paste the token when prompted.

    ```
    Open this URL in your browser to get a config token:
    https://app.slack.com/apps-api/...

    Paste the config refresh token here: █
    ```

    This token lets the script create and update your Slack app via the API. It's stored in `.slack-dev.json` and refreshed automatically on future runs.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Create the Slack app

    Using the config token, the script calls the Slack API to create your app with a pre-built manifest that configures:

    - Socket Mode (WebSocket events)
    - Bot scopes and permissions
    - Slash commands
    - Event subscriptions
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Obtain an app-level token

    The script prompts you to create an **app-level token** (`xapp-`) in your new Slack app's settings page. This token is what opens the WebSocket connection for Socket Mode.

    ```
    Open your app settings and create an app-level token:
    https://api.slack.com/apps/<your-app-id>/general

    Paste the app-level token (xapp-...): █
    ```

    <Tip>
    When creating the token in Slack, give it the `connections:write` scope. Save the token — Slack only shows it once.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run the OAuth flow

    The script starts a temporary local server and launches the Slack OAuth flow in your browser. After you authorize the app to your workspace, Slack redirects back to the local server, which captures the **bot token** (`xoxb-`) automatically.

    No manual pasting required for this step.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Write credentials to `.env`

    All credentials are written to your `.env` file automatically:

    ```dotenv
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-1-...
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
    SLACK_CLIENT_ID=1234567890.123456789
    SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=abc123...
    SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=def456...
    ```

    Configuration (including the refresh token) is also saved to `.slack-dev.json`, which is git-ignored.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Subsequent runs

On re-runs, the script reads `.slack-dev.json` and refreshes the configuration token automatically. You'll see:

```bash
pnpm setup-slack-dev

✓ Loaded existing dev config (frost-ember)
✓ Refreshed config token
✓ Updated app manifest
✓ Wrote credentials to .env
```

No manual input needed unless `.slack-dev.json` is deleted.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | App-level token (`xapp-`) — opens the WebSocket connection for Socket Mode |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token (`xoxb-`) — used for all Slack API calls |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth app client ID |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth app client secret |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Verifies incoming Slack request signatures |

## Persistent configuration

The script stores state in `.slack-dev.json` at the repository root:

```json
{
  "devIdentifier": "frost-ember",
  "appId": "A012ABCDE34",
  "configRefreshToken": "...",
  "clientId": "...",
  "clientSecret": "...",
  "signingSecret": "..."
}
```

<Warning>
`.slack-dev.json` contains sensitive credentials. It's git-ignored by default — never commit it.
</Warning>

If you need to start fresh (e.g., your app was deleted from Slack), delete `.slack-dev.json` and run `pnpm setup-slack-dev` again.
