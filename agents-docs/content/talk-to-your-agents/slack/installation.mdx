description: Admin guide — install the Inkeep Slack app, configure agents, and onboard your team.
---

This guide is for **workspace administrators**. It walks you through installing the Inkeep Slack app, configuring which agents respond, and getting your team onboarded.

<Note>
The Slack integration is only available for [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav).
</Note>

<Note>
Only one Slack workspace can be connected per Inkeep tenant. Re-authorizing the same workspace (e.g. to refresh tokens) is supported, but installing a different workspace requires uninstalling the existing one first.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- An Inkeep Enterprise account with at least one project and agent configured
- **Slack workspace admin** access (required to install apps)

## Install the app

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Work Apps dashboard

    Navigate to your Inkeep dashboard and select **Work Apps** from the sidebar. You'll see the Slack integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install to Slack

    Click **Install** on the Slack card. This redirects you to Slack's OAuth consent screen where you authorize the Inkeep bot to join your workspace.

    The bot requests the following permissions:
    - Read messages in channels where it's mentioned
    - Post messages and replies
    - Access channel and user information
    - Register slash commands
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the installation

    After authorizing, you're redirected back to the dashboard. The Slack card now shows your workspace as **Installed** with the workspace name.

    Verify the bot is active by typing `/inkeep help` in any Slack channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure agents

After installing, set up which agent responds to your team's requests. See the full [Configuration guide](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/configuration) for details.

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the dashboard
2. Set default agents for your workspace and channels

<Tip>
Channel defaults take priority over the workspace default. If you remove a channel default, that channel falls back to the workspace default agent.
</Tip>

## Onboard your team

Account linking happens automatically — when an unlinked user first interacts with the bot (via `@Inkeep` or `/inkeep`), they receive a prompt with a **Link Account** button. After clicking it and signing in to Inkeep, their original question is automatically answered. This only needs to happen once per user.

Alternatively, users can link proactively by running `/inkeep link` in any channel.

<Tip>
The link button uses a short-lived JWT token (10 minutes) for security. If it expires, the user can simply ask their question again to get a new prompt, or run `/inkeep link` manually.
</Tip>

## Uninstalling

To remove the Slack app from your workspace:

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the dashboard
2. Click the workspace options menu
3. Select **Uninstall**

This removes the bot from your workspace, deletes all user link mappings, and cleans up channel configurations.
