description: Admin guide — install the Inkeep Slack app, configure agents, and onboard your team.
---

This guide is for **workspace administrators**. It walks you through installing the Inkeep Slack app, configuring which agents respond, and getting your team onboarded.

<Note>
The Slack integration is only available for [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- An Inkeep Enterprise account with at least one project and agent configured
- **Slack workspace admin** access (required to install apps)

## Install the app

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Work Apps dashboard

    Navigate to your Inkeep dashboard and select **Work Apps** from the sidebar. You'll see the Slack integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install to Slack

    Click **Install** on the Slack card. This redirects you to Slack's OAuth consent screen where you authorize the Inkeep bot to join your workspace.

    The bot requests the following permissions:
    - Read messages in channels where it's mentioned
    - Post messages and replies
    - Access channel and user information
    - Register slash commands
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the installation

    After authorizing, you're redirected back to the dashboard. The Slack card now shows your workspace as **Installed** with the workspace name.

    Verify the bot is active by typing `/inkeep help` in any Slack channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure agents

After installing, set up which agent responds to your team's requests. See the full [Configuration guide](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/configuration) for details.

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the dashboard
2. Set default agents for your workspace and channels

<Tip>
Channel defaults take priority over the workspace default. If you remove a channel default, that channel falls back to the workspace default agent.
</Tip>

## Onboard your team

Team members can start using `@Inkeep` and `/inkeep` immediately, and you can point them to the [Using the Slack App](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/commands) usage guide.

The first time they use a command, the bot will prompt them to sign into Inkeep and link their Slack account.
1. Type `/inkeep link` in any Slack channel
2. Click the private link the bot sends (expires in 10 minutes)
3. Sign in to Inkeep if not already signed in
4. Verify with `/inkeep status`

## Uninstalling

To remove the Slack app from your workspace:

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the dashboard
2. Click the workspace options menu
3. Select **Uninstall**

This removes the bot from your workspace, deletes all user link mappings, and cleans up channel configurations.
