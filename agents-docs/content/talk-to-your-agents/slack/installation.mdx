# Install the Slack App

Connect your Slack workspace to Inkeep so your team can interact with AI agents directly from Slack.

## Prerequisites

- An Inkeep account with at least one project and agent configured
- **Slack workspace admin** access (required to install apps)
- Your Inkeep deployment running with the Slack environment variables configured

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Work Apps dashboard

    Navigate to your Inkeep dashboard and select **Work Apps** from the sidebar. You'll see the Slack integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install to Slack

    Click **Install** on the Slack card. This redirects you to Slack's OAuth consent screen where you authorize the Inkeep bot to join your workspace.

    The bot requests the following permissions:
    - Read messages in channels where it's mentioned
    - Post messages and replies
    - Access channel and user information
    - Register slash commands
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the installation

    After authorizing, you're redirected back to the dashboard. The Slack card should now show your workspace as **Installed** with the workspace name.

    You can verify the bot is active by typing `/inkeep help` in any Slack channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Link your account

Each user needs to link their Slack account to their Inkeep account before using agents. This is a one-time setup.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run the link command

    In any Slack channel, type:

    ```
    /inkeep link
    ```

    The bot responds with a private link that expires in 10 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Complete the linking

    Click the link to open the Inkeep dashboard. If you're already signed in, the linking completes automatically. If not, sign in first.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify your link

    Run `/inkeep status` to confirm your account is linked. You'll see your Inkeep account email and the active agent for the current channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Account linking uses a short-lived JWT token for security. If the link expires, run `/inkeep link` again to get a fresh one.
</Tip>

## Uninstalling

To remove the Slack app from your workspace:

1. Go to the **Work Apps** → **Slack** dashboard
2. Click the workspace options menu
3. Select **Uninstall**

This removes the bot from your workspace, deletes all user link mappings, and cleans up channel configurations.
