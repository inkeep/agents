# Install and Set Up the Slack App

This guide is for **workspace administrators**. It walks you through installing the Inkeep Slack app, configuring which agents respond, and getting your team onboarded.

<Note>
The AI Assistant for Slack is a **cloud-only** feature. On Inkeep Cloud, all required Slack environment variables are pre-configured — you don't need to set anything up on the infrastructure side.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- An Inkeep Cloud account with at least one project and agent configured
- **Slack workspace admin** access (required to install apps)

## Install the app

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Work Apps dashboard

    Navigate to your Inkeep dashboard and select **Work Apps** from the sidebar. You'll see the Slack integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install to Slack

    Click **Install** on the Slack card. This redirects you to Slack's OAuth consent screen where you authorize the Inkeep bot to join your workspace.

    The bot requests the following permissions:
    - Read messages in channels where it's mentioned
    - Post messages and replies
    - Access channel and user information
    - Register slash commands
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the installation

    After authorizing, you're redirected back to the dashboard. The Slack card now shows your workspace as **Installed** with the workspace name.

    Verify the bot is active by typing `/inkeep help` in any Slack channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure agents

After installing, set up which agent responds to your team's requests. See the full [Configuration guide](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/configuration) for details.

**Quick start:**

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the dashboard
2. Set a **Workspace default** agent — this is the agent that responds in all channels by default
3. Optionally set **Channel defaults** for channels that need a different agent (e.g. a support agent for `#support`)

<Tip>
Channel defaults take priority over the workspace default. If you remove a channel default, that channel falls back to the workspace default agent.
</Tip>

## Onboard your team

Account linking happens automatically — when an unlinked user first interacts with the bot (via `@Inkeep` or `/inkeep`), they receive a prompt with a **Link Account** button. After clicking it and signing in to Inkeep, their original question is automatically answered. This only needs to happen once per user.

Alternatively, users can link proactively by running `/inkeep link` in any channel.

<Tip>
The link button uses a short-lived JWT token (10 minutes) for security. If it expires, the user can simply ask their question again to get a new prompt, or run `/inkeep link` manually.
</Tip>

Once linked, team members can start using `@Inkeep` and `/inkeep` immediately. Point them to the [Using the Slack App](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/commands) guide for a full command reference.

## Uninstalling

To remove the Slack app from your workspace:

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the dashboard
2. Click the workspace options menu
3. Select **Uninstall**

This removes the bot from your workspace, deletes all user link mappings, and cleans up channel configurations.
