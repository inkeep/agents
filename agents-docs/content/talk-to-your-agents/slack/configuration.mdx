# Configure Slack Agents

<Note>
This page is for **workspace administrators**. Regular team members should see [Using the Slack App](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/commands) for usage instructions.
</Note>

After installing the Slack app, configure which agents respond to your team's messages. You can set a workspace-wide default and optionally assign different agents to specific channels.

## Workspace default

The workspace default agent responds to all `@Inkeep` mentions and `/inkeep` commands across every channel — unless a channel has its own default.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Slack dashboard

    Navigate to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the Inkeep dashboard. Select your installed workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Set the default agent

    In the **Agent Configuration** section, select a project and agent from the dropdowns. Click **Save**.

    This agent handles all requests in channels without a channel-specific default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Join from Workspace

When **Join from Workspace** is enabled, Slack users who don't yet have an Inkeep account are automatically invited when they run `/inkeep link`. Instead of requiring a separate admin invitation, the system creates one on the fly and sends the user a **Create Account** message directly in Slack.

The flow works as follows:

1. A Slack user runs `/inkeep link`
2. Inkeep checks whether the workspace has Join from Workspace enabled and verifies the user doesn't already have an account
3. If eligible, a pending invitation is created (or an existing one is reused)
4. The user receives a **Create Account** button in Slack that links to the signup page
5. After creating their account, Slack linking completes automatically

If the user already has an Inkeep account, the standard link flow is used instead.

### Enable Join from Workspace

In the Slack dashboard, locate the **Join from Workspace** card and toggle **Allow workspace members to join** on.

## Channel defaults

Channel defaults let you assign a specific agent to individual channels. This is useful when different channels need different expertise — for example, a support agent for `#support` and a technical agent for `#engineering`.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open channel defaults

    In the Slack dashboard, scroll to the **Channel Defaults** section. You'll see a list of all channels the bot has access to.

    <Note>
    Private channels only appear in this list after you add the Inkeep bot to them in Slack. Open the private channel in Slack, add `@Inkeep` as a member, and the channel will then be available for configuration in the dashboard.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Filter and select channels

    Use the filter buttons to view **All**, **Private**, or **Slack Connect** channels.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Assign an agent

    Choose a project and agent for the selected channels. You can configure channels individually or use **bulk actions** to assign the same agent to multiple channels at once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Grant access to channel members

When you assign an agent to a channel, a **Grant access to members** toggle appears in the channel's agent selector. This controls whether channel members can use the assigned agent without being explicit project members.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Enabled** (default) | Channel members can use the agent via `@Inkeep` and `/inkeep` without needing explicit project access. The channel configuration acts as implicit authorization. |
| **Disabled** | Channel members must have explicit project access (configured separately) to use the agent. The channel default still determines *which* agent responds, but doesn't grant access. |

<Tip>
This toggle defaults to **enabled** — assigning an agent to a channel automatically grants access to all channel members. Disable it if you want to control project access separately (e.g., for channels where only certain members should use the agent).
</Tip>

<Note>
The grant access setting applies per channel. Workspace defaults grant access by default — the toggle is only available in the UI for channel-level overrides.
</Note>

## Agent resolution priority

When a team member uses `@Inkeep` or `/inkeep`, the app resolves which agent to use:

| Priority | Source | Scope | Example |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Channel default** | Specific channel only | `#support` → "Support Agent" |
| 2 | **Workspace default** | All other channels | Everything else → "General Assistant" |

<Tip>
Channel defaults take priority over the workspace default. If you remove a channel default, that channel falls back to the workspace default agent.
</Tip>

## Managing linked users

The dashboard shows all users who have linked their Slack accounts to Inkeep. You can:

- **View** linked users with their Slack username, email, and link date
- **Export** the linked users list as CSV
- **Unlink** a user if needed (the user can re-link with `/inkeep link`)

## Workspace health

The dashboard includes a health check that verifies:

- **Bot connection** — The bot token is valid and the bot is accessible
- **Permissions** — The bot can post messages, read channels, and read history
- **Workspace info** — Team name and bot identity are correct

If the health check shows issues, try reinstalling the Slack app from the dashboard.

## Permission model

| Action | Required role |
|--------|-------------|
| Install / uninstall the app | Organization admin or owner |
| Set workspace default agent | Organization admin or owner |
| Set channel defaults | Organization admin, or channel member |
| View configuration | Any authenticated user in the organization |
| Enable / disable Join from Workspace | Organization admin or owner |
