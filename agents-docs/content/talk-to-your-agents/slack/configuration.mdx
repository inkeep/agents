<Note>
This page is for **workspace administrators**. Regular team members should see [Using the Slack App](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/commands) for usage instructions.
</Note>

After installing the Slack app, configure which agents respond to your team's messages. You can set a workspace-wide default and optionally assign different agents to specific channels.

## Workspace default

The workspace default agent responds to all `@Inkeep` mentions and `/inkeep` commands across every channel — unless a channel has its own default.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Slack dashboard

    Navigate to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the Inkeep dashboard. Select your installed workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Set the default agent

    In the **Agent Configuration** section, select a project and agent from the dropdowns. Click **Save**.

    This agent handles all requests in channels without a channel-specific default.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Remove the default agent (optional)

    To clear the workspace default, open the dropdown and select **Remove default agent**. Channels without a channel-specific agent will no longer have a fallback.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Channel defaults

Channel defaults let you assign a specific agent to individual channels. This is useful when different channels need different expertise — for example, a support agent for `#support` and a technical agent for `#engineering`.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open channel defaults

    In the Slack dashboard, scroll to the **Channel Defaults** section. You'll see a list of all channels the bot has access to.

    <Note>
    Private channels only appear in this list after you add the Inkeep bot to them in Slack. Open the private channel in Slack, add `@Inkeep` as a member, and the channel will then be available for configuration in the dashboard.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Filter and select channels

    Use the filter buttons to view **All**, **Private**, or **Slack Connect** channels.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Assign an agent

    Choose a project and agent for the selected channels. You can configure channels individually or use **bulk actions** to assign the same agent to multiple channels at once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Grant access to channel members

When you assign an agent to a channel, a **Grant access to members** toggle appears in the channel's agent selector. This controls whether channel members can use the assigned agent without being explicit project members.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Enabled** (default) | Channel members can use the agent via `@Inkeep` and `/inkeep` without needing explicit project access. The channel configuration acts as implicit authorization. |
| **Disabled** | Channel members must have explicit project access (configured separately) to use the agent. The channel default still determines *which* agent responds, but doesn't grant access. |

<Tip>
This toggle defaults to **enabled** — assigning an agent to a channel automatically grants access to all channel members. Disable it if you want to control project access separately (e.g., for channels where only certain members should use the agent).
</Tip>

<Note>
The grant access setting applies per channel. Workspace defaults grant access by default — the toggle is only available in the UI for channel-level overrides.
</Note>

## Agent resolution priority

When a team member uses `@Inkeep` or `/inkeep`, the app resolves which agent to use:

| Priority | Source | Scope | Example |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Channel default** | Specific channel only | `#support` → "Support Agent" |
| 2 | **Workspace default** | All other channels | Everything else → "General Assistant" |

<Tip>
Channel defaults take priority over the workspace default. If you remove a channel default, that channel falls back to the workspace default agent.
</Tip>

## Managing linked users

The dashboard shows all users who have linked their Slack accounts to Inkeep. You can:

- **View** linked users with their Slack username, email, and link date
- **Export** the linked users list as CSV
- **Unlink** a user if needed (the user can re-link with `/inkeep link`)

## Workspace health

The dashboard includes a health check that verifies:

- **Bot connection** — The bot token is valid and the bot is accessible
- **Permissions** — The bot can post messages, read channels, and read history
- **Workspace info** — Team name and bot identity are correct

If the health check shows issues, try reinstalling the Slack app from the dashboard.

## Permission model

| Action | Required role |
|--------|-------------|
| Install / uninstall the app | Organization admin or owner |
| Set workspace default agent | Organization admin or owner |
| Set channel defaults | Organization admin, or channel member |
| View configuration | Any authenticated user in the organization |

## Tracking Slack conversations

Slack conversations are automatically tracked in the Inkeep dashboard. You can identify them across several surfaces:

- **Conversation list** — Slack conversations display a `#` badge so you can spot them at a glance
- **Trace timeline** — Individual Slack messages show a `#` icon with Slack-purple styling in the trace detail view
- **Stats page** — A dedicated **Slack Conversations** card shows the total count of conversations originating from Slack

<Tip>
For advanced filtering in SigNoz, use the `invocation.type='slack'` span attribute to query Slack-originated traces. Only conversations created after this feature was enabled are included in the count.
</Tip>
