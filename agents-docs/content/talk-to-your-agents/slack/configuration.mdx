# Configure Slack Agents

<Note>
This page is for **workspace administrators**. Regular team members should see [Using the Slack App](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/commands) for usage instructions.
</Note>

After installing the Slack app, configure which agents respond to your team's messages. You can set a workspace-wide default and optionally assign different agents to specific channels.

## Workspace default

The workspace default agent responds to all `@Inkeep` mentions and `/inkeep` commands across every channel — unless a channel has its own default.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Slack dashboard

    Navigate to **Work Apps** → **Slack** in the Inkeep dashboard. Select your installed workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Set the default agent

    In the **Agent Configuration** section, select a project and agent from the dropdowns. Click **Save**.

    This agent handles all requests in channels without a channel-specific default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Channel defaults

Channel defaults let you assign a specific agent to individual channels. This is useful when different channels need different expertise — for example, a support agent for `#support` and a technical agent for `#engineering`.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open channel defaults

    In the Slack dashboard, scroll to the **Channel Defaults** section. You'll see a list of all channels the bot has access to.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Filter and select channels

    Use the filter buttons to view **All**, **Private**, or **Slack Connect** channels.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Assign an agent

    Choose a project and agent for the selected channels. You can configure channels individually or use **bulk actions** to assign the same agent to multiple channels at once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent resolution priority

When a team member uses `@Inkeep` or `/inkeep`, the app resolves which agent to use:

| Priority | Source | Scope | Example |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Channel default** | Specific channel only | `#support` → "Support Agent" |
| 2 | **Workspace default** | All other channels | Everything else → "General Assistant" |

<Tip>
Channel defaults take priority over the workspace default. If you remove a channel default, that channel falls back to the workspace default agent.
</Tip>

## Managing linked users

The dashboard shows all users who have linked their Slack accounts to Inkeep. You can:

- **View** linked users with their Slack username, email, and link date
- **Export** the linked users list as CSV
- **Unlink** a user if needed (the user can re-link with `/inkeep link`)

## Workspace health

The dashboard includes a health check that verifies:

- **Bot connection** — The bot token is valid and the bot is accessible
- **Permissions** — The bot can post messages, read channels, and read history
- **Workspace info** — Team name and bot identity are correct

If the health check shows issues, try reinstalling the Slack app from the dashboard.
