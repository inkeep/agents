<Note>
The Slack integration is only available for [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav).
</Note>

The Slack Work App brings your Inkeep agents directly into Slack. Team members can interact with agents by mentioning `@Inkeep` or by using `/inkeep` commands.

## Key features

- **Public responses** — `@Inkeep <message>` in any channel to get an agent response visible to everyone in a thread
- **Private responses** — `/inkeep <message>` for ephemeral responses only you can see, with multi-turn follow-up support
- **Thread context** — Mention `@Inkeep` in a thread to give the agent full conversation context
- **Rich content** — Agents can return structured data, citations, artifacts, and error messages as interactive Slack blocks
- **Agent configuration** — Set a workspace-wide default agent, or assign specific agents to individual channels
- **Account linking** — Each Slack user links their account to Inkeep via `/inkeep link` for personalized, secure access
- **Channel-based authorization** — When an admin assigns an agent to a channel, members can use that agent without needing explicit project access
