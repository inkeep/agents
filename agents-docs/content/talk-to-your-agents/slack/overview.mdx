The Slack Work App brings your Inkeep agents directly into Slack. Team members can talk to agents by mentioning `@Inkeep` or by using `/inkeep` commands.

<Note>
The Slack integration is only available for [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav).
</Note>

## Key features

- **`@Inkeep` and `/inkeep`** — Mention `@Inkeep` or use `/inkeep` commands in a channel or your DMs to talk to an Inkeep agent.
- **Channel configuration** — Set a workspace-wide default agent, or assign specific agents to individual channels

## Which agent handles my request?

The app uses an **agent resolution priority** to decide which agent responds:

| Priority | Source | Set by | Scope |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Channel default** | Admin, via the dashboard | Only that channel |
| 2 | **Workspace default** | Admin, via the dashboard | All channels without a channel default |

If no agent is configured at either level, the bot prompts you to ask an admin to set one up in the dashboard.

<Tip>
Use `/inkeep status` in any channel to see which agent is active for that channel and how it was resolved.
