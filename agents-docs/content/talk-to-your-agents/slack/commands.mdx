# Slack Commands Reference

The Inkeep Slack app supports two interaction modes: **public** responses via `@Inkeep` mentions and **private** responses via `/inkeep` slash commands.

## Public — `@Inkeep`

Public responses are visible to everyone in the channel. They appear as threaded replies.

| Usage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `@Inkeep <message>` | Send a message to your agent. The response appears in a thread. |
| `@Inkeep <message>` in a thread | Send a message with the full thread included as context for the agent. |
| `@Inkeep` in a thread | Trigger the agent using the entire thread as context (no additional message needed). |
| `@Inkeep` with no message | Shows a usage hint explaining how to use @mentions. |

<Note>
The `@Inkeep` message itself is posted to the channel by Slack before the bot receives it — this is a Slack platform behavior and can't be suppressed.
</Note>

### Thread context

When you use `@Inkeep` inside a thread, the agent automatically receives the full conversation history as context. This lets the agent understand what's being discussed and provide relevant responses.

The thread content is treated as untrusted user input and wrapped in safety delimiters before being sent to the agent.

## Private — `/inkeep`

Private responses are **ephemeral** — only you can see them. They don't appear in the channel for other users.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/inkeep <message>` | Send a message to the default agent. Response is private. |
| `/inkeep` | Open a modal to select a project, agent, and write your prompt. |
| `/inkeep run "agent name" <message>` | Send a message to a specific agent by name. |
| `/inkeep help` | Show the full usage guide. |
| `/inkeep status` | Check your linked account and the active agent for the current channel. |
| `/inkeep link` | Link your Slack account to your Inkeep account (one-time setup). |
| `/inkeep unlink` | Disconnect your Slack account from Inkeep. |
| `/inkeep list` | List all available agents. |

### Multi-turn conversations

When you use `/inkeep` (modal) or `/inkeep <message>`, the response includes a **Follow Up** button. Clicking it opens a new prompt modal that continues the same conversation — the agent remembers everything from previous turns.

Each follow-up response appears as a new ephemeral message showing your question and the agent's response.

### Agent picker modal

Running `/inkeep` with no arguments opens a modal where you can:

1. **Select a project** from the dropdown
2. **Select an agent** from that project
3. **Write your prompt**
4. Submit to get a private response

The modal also includes a link to the dashboard for managing agents.

## Agent resolution

When you use `@Inkeep` or `/inkeep`, the app determines which agent to use based on this priority:

| Priority | Source | Set by |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Channel default** | Admin, via the dashboard |
| 2 | **Workspace default** | Admin, via the dashboard |

If no agent is configured, you'll see a prompt directing you to the dashboard to set one up.

<Tip>
Use `/inkeep status` to see which agent is active for the current channel.

## Troubleshooting

### "You need to link your account"

Run `/inkeep link` and click the link to connect your Slack and Inkeep accounts. This is a one-time setup per user.

### "No agents configured"

An organization admin needs to set a workspace or channel default agent in the dashboard at **Work Apps** → **Slack**.

### "Request timed out"

The agent took too long to respond. Try again — if the issue persists, check that your Inkeep deployment is running and healthy.

### Command shows "failed with error"

This typically means the bot couldn't process the command. Check that:
- The Slack app is properly installed (try `/inkeep help`)
- Your account is linked (`/inkeep status`)
- An agent is configured for the workspace
