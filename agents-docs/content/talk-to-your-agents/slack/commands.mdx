description: How to talk to Inkeep agents in Slack — commands, mentions, and tips.
---

This guide is for **all team members** using the Inkeep Slack app. You'll learn how to ask questions, understand which agent responds, and get the most out of the integration.

## Before you start

You need to link your Slack account to Inkeep (one-time setup). The first time you interact with the bot — via `@Inkeep` or any `/inkeep` command — you'll automatically receive a **Link Account** button. Click it, sign in to Inkeep, and your original question will be answered automatically.

You can also link proactively by running `/inkeep link` in any channel.

Run `/inkeep status` to confirm your account is linked.

## Public responses — `@Inkeep`

Public responses are visible to **everyone in the channel**. They appear as threaded replies.

| Usage | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| `@Inkeep <your question>` | Posts a response in a thread, visible to the whole channel |
| `@Inkeep <question>` in a thread | Includes the full thread as context for a more relevant answer |
| `@Inkeep` in a thread (no message) | Uses the entire thread as the question — great for "explain this conversation" |
| `@Inkeep` with no message (in a channel) | Shows a usage hint |

<Note>
The `@Inkeep` message itself is posted to the channel by Slack — this is standard Slack behavior and can't be suppressed.
</Note>

### Thread context

When you use `@Inkeep` inside a thread, the agent automatically receives the full conversation history as context. This is useful for:
- Getting a summary of a long discussion
- Asking follow-up questions about something in the thread
- Having the agent help draft a response

## Slash command — `/inkeep`

The `/inkeep` slash command lets you ask questions and manage your account. Agent responses to `/inkeep <your question>` are posted **publicly in the channel**, visible to everyone. Administrative commands (`link`, `unlink`, `status`, `help`) respond privately using Slack's ephemeral messages.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/inkeep <your question>` | Ask the default agent — response is posted in the channel |
| `/inkeep` | Open a modal to pick a project, agent, and write your prompt |
| `/inkeep help` | Show the full usage guide |
| `/inkeep status` | See your linked account and the active agent for this channel |
| `/inkeep link` | Link your Slack account to Inkeep (one-time) |
| `/inkeep unlink` | Disconnect your Slack account |

### Agent picker modal

Running `/inkeep` with no arguments opens a modal where you can:

1. Select a **project** from the dropdown
2. Select an **agent** from that project (the list updates as you change projects)
3. Optionally write a **prompt** (you can also submit without a message to invoke the agent directly)
4. Submit to get a public response at the channel root

<Tip>
To continue a conversation, `@Inkeep` the bot in the response thread — the agent receives the full thread as context.
</Tip>

## Message shortcuts

Right-click (or long-press on mobile) any message in a channel and select **Ask Agent** from the shortcuts menu. This opens a modal where you pick a project and agent, then submit. The agent's response appears as a **threaded reply on the target message**, with the original message text as context.

## Direct messages

You can mention `@Inkeep` or use `/inkeep` commands in your DMs for private conversations. Direct messaging the bot without a mention or command is not currently supported.

| Usage | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| `@Inkeep <your question>` in a DM | The workspace default agent responds in a thread |
| `/inkeep <your question>` in a DM | The workspace default agent responds |
| Reply in a DM thread | The agent receives the full DM thread as context |

DMs use your **workspace default agent**. Channel-specific agent overrides do not apply in DMs. You must have your account linked and have access to the agent's project.

## Which agent responds?

The agent that handles your request depends on how your admin configured the workspace:

| Priority | What's checked | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **1st** | Channel default — has an admin assigned a specific agent to this channel? | `#support` → "Support Agent" |
| **2nd** | Workspace default — the fallback agent for all channels | "General Assistant" |

**In practice:**
- If you're in `#support` and the admin set a "Support Agent" for that channel → you get the Support Agent
- If you're in `#random` with no channel-specific agent → you get the workspace default
- If no agent is configured at all → the bot tells you to ask an admin to set one up

<Tip>
Run `/inkeep status` to see exactly which agent is active in the current channel and whether it's a channel default or workspace default.
</Tip>

## Tool approvals

Some agents use tools that require your approval before they run. When this happens, you'll see an interactive message in the thread with the tool name, its inputs, and **Approve** / **Deny** buttons.

### Approving or denying

- Click **Approve** to let the agent run the tool
- Click **Deny** to block the tool — the agent will acknowledge and may suggest alternatives

Only the person who started the conversation can approve or deny. If you're not the requester, you'll see an error if you try to click the buttons.

### Approval timeout

If you don't respond within a few minutes, the approval request expires. The message updates to show "Expired" and the agent is notified.

<Tip>
If you frequently use agents that require tool approvals, make sure your account is linked (`/inkeep link`) beforehand to avoid interruptions.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "You need to link your account"

Click the **Link Account** button in the prompt to connect your Slack and Inkeep accounts. This is a one-time setup per user. If you don't see the button, run `/inkeep link` to get a new link.

### "No agents configured"

Ask your workspace admin to set a workspace or channel default agent in the Inkeep dashboard at **Work Apps** → **Slack**.

### "Request timed out"

The agent took too long to respond. Try again — if the issue persists, ask your admin to check that the Inkeep deployment is running and healthy.

### Command shows "failed with error"

Check that:
- The Slack app is properly installed (try `/inkeep help`)
- Your account is linked (`/inkeep status`)
- An agent is configured for the workspace
