The Inkeep chat components provide pre-built UI elements to quickly integrate conversational AI into your application. These components handle the chat interface, message streaming, and user interactions out of the box.

## Available Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Chat Button](/talk-to-your-agents/react/chat-button) | A floating button that opens a chat modal |
| [Custom Trigger](/talk-to-your-agents/react/custom-trigger) | Use your own button or element to trigger the chat |
| [Side Bar Chat](/talk-to-your-agents/react/side-bar-chat) | A chat panel that slides in from the side |
| [Embedded Chat](/talk-to-your-agents/react/embedded-chat) | A chat component embedded directly in your page |

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="npm"
npm install @inkeep/agents-ui
```

```bash title="yarn"
yarn add @inkeep/agents-ui
```

```bash title="pnpm"
pnpm add @inkeep/agents-ui
```

</CodeGroup>

## Framework Support

The chat components are available for:

- **[React](/talk-to-your-agents/react/chat-button)** - Native React components with full TypeScript support
- **[Next.js](/talk-to-your-agents/nextjs/chat-button)** - Same React components with App Router–friendly setup (dynamic import, `"use client"`)
- **[JavaScript](/talk-to-your-agents/javascript/chat-button)** - Vanilla JavaScript for any framework or plain HTML

## Automatic Headers

The chat components automatically send the following headers with each request to provide client context:

| Header | Description | Example Value |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `x-inkeep-client-timestamp` | The client's current timestamp in ISO 8601 format | `2025-01-30T18:15:00.000Z` |
| `x-inkeep-client-timezone` | The client's timezone identifier | `America/New_York` |

These headers enable your agents to provide time-aware responses. See [Headers](/typescript-sdk/headers#widget-provided-headers) to learn how to use these values in your agent configuration.
