# Making a Contribution

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agent Framework! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

# Launch the Visual Builder

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22.18 or higher (matches `.node-version`)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 10.10 or higher (matches `packageManager`)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agents.git
cd agents
```

### Step 2: Run the setup script

For first-time setup, run:

```bash
pnpm setup-dev
```

This will:

- Create `.env` from `.env.example` if missing
- Create `~/.inkeep/config` for user-global settings if missing
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if needed
- Install dependencies
- Start Doltgres (manage) + Postgres (runtime) + SpiceDB (authorization) via `docker-compose.dbs.yml` and run migrations

Add API keys for the AI providers you want to use in the root `.env` or `~/.inkeep/config`. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required.

```dotenv
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xyz789
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx # optional
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=sk-xxx # optional
```

### Step 3: Run the agent framework

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 4: Start building!

Open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser and start building agents.

# Push your project

A key advantage of the Inkeep agent framework is its seamless code-to-visual workflow: define your agents programmatically, push them to the Visual Builder, and continue developing with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

Follow the steps below to push your project using the [Inkeep CLI](/typescript-sdk/cli-reference).

### Step 1: Download the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm add -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 2: Push the project

```bash
cd agents-cookbook/template-projects/weather-project
inkeep push
```

<Note>
  The CLI reads `tenantId` and API URLs from the nearest `inkeep.config.ts` (it searches parent
  directories). The cookbook templates default to `tenantId: 'default'` and `agentsApi.url:
  'http://localhost:3002'`. Update `agents-cookbook/template-projects/inkeep.config.ts` if needed.
</Note>

### Step 3: Observe the Agent in the Visual Builder

# Set up live traces

For full instructions, see [Traces](/get-started/traces). Short version:

- For local SigNoz, clone `agents-optional-local-dev` and run `docker-compose --profile signoz up -d`.
- Set `SIGNOZ_URL`, `SIGNOZ_API_KEY`, and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` in the root `.env` (see `.env.example`).
- Restart `pnpm dev`, then open `http://localhost:3080` to view traces.

# Set up credentials

For Nango setup (cloud or local), follow [Use Nango as a credential store](/typescript-sdk/credentials/nango). Short version:

- Set `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` in the root `.env`.
- For local Nango, start services from `agents-optional-local-dev` (`docker-compose --profile nango up -d`) and set `NANGO_SERVER_URL` / `PUBLIC_NANGO_CONNECT_BASE_URL` as needed (see `.env.example`).
- Restart `pnpm dev`, then create a credential in the Visual Builder (Credentials tab).

# Development Workflow

### Conductor

The repo includes a `conductor.json` that automatically configures Claude Code workspaces with the correct permissions and skills. No manual setup needed.

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky for Git hooks to maintain code quality. The hooks are automatically installed when you run `pnpm install`.

#### Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook runs `pnpm lint-staged`, which:

- Formats and lints staged files with Biome
- Runs `agents-api` tests for affected changes

#### Pre-push Hook

The pre-push hook runs `pnpm check:prepush` (lint, typecheck, and tests) for all packages except docs and cookbook templates.

##### Bypassing Checks

While we recommend running all checks, there are legitimate cases where you might need to bypass hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: hotfix for production"
```

> **Note:** Use these bypass mechanisms sparingly. They're intended for:
>
> - Work-in-progress commits that you'll fix before pushing
> - Emergency fixes where speed is critical
> - Commits that only touch non-code files (though hooks are smart enough to handle this)

### Local checks (CI parity)

- `pnpm check` runs lint, typecheck, and tests (the same set CI runs).
- CI also runs `pnpm format:check` and `pnpm knip`.
- For package-specific commands, see `AGENTS.md` below.

# CLI Development

## Running the CLI Locally

When developing the CLI, you can run the local version directly without global installation:

```bash
# Build the CLI first
cd agents-cli
pnpm build

# Run the local CLI from the repository root
node agents-cli/dist/index.js --version
```

## Testing CLI Changes

1. **Build the CLI after making changes:**

```bash
cd agents-cli
pnpm build
```

2. **Test commands locally:**

```bash
# From repository root
node agents-cli/dist/index.js push agents-cookbook/template-projects/weather-project
node agents-cli/dist/index.js --help
```

3. **Run CLI tests:**

```bash
cd agents-cli
pnpm test
```

## Switching Between Local and Published CLI

During development, you may need to test both the local development version and the published npm package:

```bash
# Use local development version
node /path/to/agents/agents-cli/dist/index.js --version

# Use globally installed published version
inkeep --version
```

For more CLI setup options, see the CLI docs:
https://docs.inkeep.com/guides/cli/overview

# Commit Messages

We recommend conventional commit format (not enforced by tooling):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

# Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure `pnpm check` passes (mirrors CI; see below)
5. Commit your changes (following commit message guidelines)
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a pull request

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update tests for any behavior changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

# Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline runs on all pull requests and includes:

- `pnpm check` (lint, typecheck, tests)
- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm knip`
- Create Agents E2E tests (separate job)

These checks must pass before a PR can be merged. Pre-commit uses lint-staged, pre-push runs `pnpm check:prepush`, and CI is the source of truth.
