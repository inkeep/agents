This tutorial walks you through pushing agent configurations to Inkeep Cloud. You'll learn how to set up a CLI profile, authenticate with your Inkeep Cloud account, and push changes made in the Visual Builder.

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Inkeep Cloud](https://inkeep.com/cloud-waitlist) or a [self-hosted deployment](/deployment/vercel)
- The Inkeep CLI installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

## Step 1: Create a cloud profile

Profiles let you manage multiple environments (cloud, local, staging) from the same CLI. Create a profile for Inkeep Cloud:

```bash
inkeep profile add <profile-name>
```

The CLI prompts you to configure the profile:

1. **Remote type**: Select **Custom**
2. **Agents API URL**: Enter the URL of your agents API
3. **Manage UI URL**: Enter the URL of your manage UI
2. **Environment name**: Enter `production` (or your preferred name)

<Tip>
You can verify the profile was created by running `inkeep profile list`.
</Tip>

### Switch to your cloud profile

Set the cloud profile as your active profile:

```bash
inkeep profile use cloud
```

You can confirm which profile is active:

```bash
inkeep profile current
```

## Step 2: Log in

Authenticate:

```bash
inkeep login
```

The CLI will:
1. Open your browser to the Inkeep authentication page
2. Display a device code (e.g., `ABCD-1234`)
3. Wait for you to complete authentication in the browser

Once authenticated, you'll see confirmation:

```
✓ Logged in as you@example.com
✓ Organization: Your Organization
✓ Profile: cloud
```

<Note>
Your credentials are securely stored in your system keychain. You only need to log in once per profile.
</Note>

## Step 3: Push changes to Inkeep Cloud

After making changes in the Visual Builder or in code, push them to Inkeep Cloud.

### Push from a project directory

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
cd my-project
inkeep push
```

The CLI will:
1. Detect the project from your `index.ts` file
2. Load configuration from `inkeep.config.ts`
3. Push all agents, tools, and configurations to Inkeep Cloud

### Push all projects at once

If you have multiple projects in a workspace, push them all:

```bash
inkeep push --all
```
