This tutorial walks you through pulling agent configurations from Inkeep Cloud to your local project. Use pull to bootstrap a local project from the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder), sync remote changes made by teammates, or set up a new development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Inkeep Cloud](https://inkeep.com/cloud-waitlist) or a [self-hosted deployment](/deployment/vercel)
- The Inkeep CLI installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

- A CLI profile configured and authenticated (only needed for remote deployments). If you haven't done this yet, follow the [Set up a CLI profile](/tutorials/cli/setup-profile) tutorial.
- An LLM API key set as an environment variable. The pull command uses LLM generation to produce TypeScript files. Set one of the following:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key    # Recommended
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key       # Alternative
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-key  # Alternative
```

## Step 1: Choose your pull target

You have two options depending on whether the project already exists locally.

### Option A: Pull into an existing project

If you already have a local project directory with an `index.ts` file, navigate into it:

```bash
cd my-project
```

### Option B: Pull a new project from the cloud

If you don't have the project locally yet, you'll specify the project ID in the next step. The CLI creates a new directory for it automatically.

## Step 2: Run the pull command

### For an existing project

From inside your project directory, run:

```bash
inkeep pull
```

The CLI will:
1. Detect the project from your `index.ts` file
2. Fetch the latest configuration from Inkeep Cloud
3. Compare remote changes against your local files
4. Generate updated TypeScript files, preserving your local code structure

<Tip>
The pull command uses smart comparison to detect what changed. If nothing has changed remotely, it tells you the project is already up to date.
</Tip>

### For a new project

Specify the project ID:

```bash
inkeep pull --project my-project-id
```

This creates a `./my-project-id/` directory with the full TypeScript project structure:

```
my-project-id/
├── index.ts                 # Project definition and wiring
├── agents/                  # Agent definitions
│   ├── my-agent.ts
│   └── sub-agents/
│       └── my-sub-agent.ts
├── tools/                   # Tool definitions
│   ├── my-tool.ts
│   └── functions/
│       └── my-function.ts
├── credentials/             # Credential references
│   └── my-credential.ts
├── environments/            # Environment-specific settings
│   ├── development.env.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── data-components/         # Data component definitions
    └── my-data-component.ts
```

## Step 3: Review the generated files

After pulling, the CLI runs a two-stage validation:

1. **File verification** -- checks that all expected files exist with correct naming
2. **Round-trip validation** -- loads the generated TypeScript, serializes it back to JSON, and compares with the original remote data to ensure no data loss

If validation passes, you'll see:

```
✓ Basic file verification passed
✓ Round-trip validation passed - generated TS matches backend data
```

Review the generated files to confirm they look correct. If validation fails, the CLI reports specific differences so you can investigate.

## Step 4: Use the pulled project

Once pulled, your project is a standard TypeScript project using `@inkeep/agents-sdk` builder APIs. You can:

- Edit agent configurations in code
- Push changes back with `inkeep push`
- Run the Visual Builder locally with `inkeep dev`

## Additional options

### Pull all projects

To pull every project from your tenant at once:

```bash
inkeep pull --all
```

Each project is created as a subdirectory in the current directory. The CLI handles existing and new projects differently:

- **Existing projects** (local `index.ts` found): Uses smart comparison to merge changes
- **New projects** (no local directory): Generates files from scratch

### Force a full regeneration

To regenerate all files from scratch, ignoring local changes:

```bash
inkeep pull --introspect
```

This bypasses the smart comparison and rebuilds every TypeScript file from the remote configuration. Use this when your local files are in a broken state or you want a clean slate that matches the cloud exactly.

<Note>
The `--introspect` flag overwrites all local files. Commit or back up any local changes you want to keep before using it.
</Note>

### Pull for a specific environment

Generate environment-specific credential files by passing the `--env` flag:

```bash
inkeep pull --env production
```

This generates credential configurations in `environments/production.env.ts` instead of the default `environments/development.env.ts`.

### Export as JSON

To inspect the raw project data without generating TypeScript files:

```bash
inkeep pull --json
```

This outputs the project configuration as JSON, which is useful for debugging or piping into other tools.
