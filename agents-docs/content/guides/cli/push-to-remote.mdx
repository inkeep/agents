This tutorial walks you through pushing agent configurations to a remote Inkeep instance.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a remote Inkeep instance (e.g. [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav) or a [self-hosted deployment](/deployment/vercel))
- The Inkeep CLI installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

- A CLI profile configured and authenticated (only needed for remote deployments). If you haven't done this yet, follow the [Set up a CLI profile](/guides/cli/setup-profile) tutorial.

## Step 1: Navigate to your project

Navigate to your project directory. A project directory contains an `index.ts` file that exports a project definition:

```bash
cd my-project
```

<Note>
Run `inkeep push` from the directory that contains your `inkeep.config.ts`, or from any subdirectory below it.
</Note>

## Step 2: Push to remote Inkeep instance

Run the push command:

```bash
inkeep push
```

The CLI will:
1. Detect the project from your `index.ts` file
2. Resolve configuration — your active [CLI profile](/guides/cli/setup-profile) overrides `inkeep.config.ts` for API URLs, API key, and tenant ID (see [Configuration Priority](/typescript-sdk/cli-reference#configuration-priority))
3. Push all agents, tools, and configurations to remote Inkeep instance

## Step 3: Verify the push

After a successful push, the CLI prints a deployment summary with resource counts. You can also verify by opening the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/sub-agents) to see your updated configurations.

## Push all projects at once

If you have multiple projects in a workspace, push them all:

```bash
inkeep push --all
```
