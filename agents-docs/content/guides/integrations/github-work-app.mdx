The GitHub Work App connects your GitHub organization or user account to Inkeep, making repositories available to your projects and MCP tools. Once installed, you control which repositories each project and MCP tool can access.

## Prerequisites

- An Inkeep tenant with admin access
- A GitHub organization or user account you have permission to install apps on

## Install the GitHub App

1. Go to [app.inkeep.com](https://app.inkeep.com), open **Work Apps** from the navigation, then select the **GitHub** tab.
2. Click **Install GitHub App** and authorize Inkeep on your GitHub organization or user account.
3. Select which repositories to grant access to (all repositories or specific ones).

<Note>
  Choosing "All repositories" on GitHub grants access to all current and future repositories in that organization. You can still restrict access at the project or MCP tool level within Inkeep.
</Note>

After installation, the GitHub App installation will appear in your Work Apps settings.

## Manage project repository access

Each project has an access mode that determines which repositories it can see across all its MCP tools. The default mode is **All**, meaning the project can access every repository available in the connected installation(s).

### Access modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **All** | Project has access to all repositories across connected GitHub installations |
| **Selected** | Project is scoped to a specific list of repositories |

### Configure project repository access

1. Go to [app.inkeep.com](https://app.inkeep.com) and open your project.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **GitHub Access**.
3. Choose your access mode:
   - Select **All repositories** to give the project access to every repository in connected installations.
   - Select **Selected repositories** and check the specific repositories you want to allow.
4. Click **Save** to apply changes.

## Manage MCP tool repository access

Individual MCP tools within a project can be scoped even further. A tool's repository access is always bounded by the project's access — a tool cannot access repositories that its project cannot.

### Access modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **All** | Tool has access to all repositories the project can access |
| **Selected** | Tool is scoped to a specific subset of the project's repositories |

### Configure MCP tool repository access

1. Go to [app.inkeep.com](https://app.inkeep.com) and open your project.
2. Navigate to **MCP Servers** and select the tool you want to configure.
3. In the tool settings, find the **GitHub Access** section.
4. Choose your access mode:
   - Select **All repositories** to give the tool access to all repositories available to the project.
   - Select **Selected repositories** and check the specific repositories you want to allow.
5. Click **Save** to apply changes.

<Note>
  MCP tool repository access is always bounded by the project's access. If a project only has access to certain repositories, tools within that project can only access those same repositories or a subset of them.
</Note>

## Manage installations

You can manage your GitHub App installations from the Work Apps settings.

### View installations

1. Go to [app.inkeep.com](https://app.inkeep.com) and open **Work Apps** → **GitHub**.
2. View all connected GitHub installations, including the organization/user name, repository count, and status.

### Disconnect an installation

Disconnecting soft-deletes the installation and removes all project repository access entries. The installation record is preserved for audit purposes. This does **not** uninstall the GitHub App from GitHub itself.

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **GitHub**.
2. Find the installation you want to disconnect.
3. Click **Disconnect**.
4. Confirm the action.

### Reconnect an installation

Restore a previously disconnected installation and re-sync its repository list:

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **GitHub**.
2. Find the disconnected installation.
3. Click **Reconnect**.

### Sync repositories

If repositories were added or removed on GitHub and the changes aren't reflected in Inkeep, manually sync to update the repository list:

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **GitHub**.
2. Find the installation you want to sync.
3. Click **Sync** to refresh the repository list from GitHub.

### Remove an installation

Permanently removes the installation record, all associated repositories, and all project repository access entries. **This action cannot be undone.** Use disconnect instead if you may want to reconnect later.

<Warning>
  Removing an installation deletes all associated data and cannot be reversed. This does not uninstall the GitHub App from GitHub — do that separately from your GitHub organization settings if needed.
</Warning>

1. Go to **Work Apps** → **GitHub**.
2. Find the installation you want to remove.
3. Click **Remove** and confirm the permanent deletion.
