Agent engineering is the discipline of designing AI agents that reliably accomplish their goals without over-constraining them. The key principle: **treat tokens and attention as a shared budget**. Prefer small, high-signal prompts plus strong output formats over long prose.

This section covers the full lifecycle of agent design — from writing effective prompts, to coordinating specialists, to testing and iterating on deployed agents.

## Who this is for

These best practices apply to anyone designing AI agents with Inkeep — whether you're building a single-purpose Sub Agent or a multi-agent system with transfers and delegation.
