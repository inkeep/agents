A well-structured prompt is the foundation of reliable agent behavior. This page covers the recommended sections for a Sub Agent prompt and how to write each one effectively.

Structure your agent prompt in this order:

1. **Role and mission** — who the agent is and what it optimizes for
2. **Scope and non-goals** — prevents accidental overreach
3. **Operating principles** — directness vs suggestions, decision frameworks
4. **Workflow checklist** — steps the agent can follow
5. **Tool-use policy** — what tools to use and when
6. **Output format** — headings, verbosity limits, evidence expectations
7. **Uncertainty and escalation** — when to ask, when to proceed, when to defer
8. **Few-shot examples (optional)** — examples that demonstrate the expected behavior and output quality

## 1. Role and mission

The role and mission sets the Sub Agent's identity and judgment frame in 2-4 sentences. It should:

- Declare what **excellence looks like** for this role (not just what it does)
- Describe behaviors the **best humans** in this role would exhibit
- Avoid escape hatches that could license poor judgment

Write in second person ("You are...", "Do..."). Avoid first-person commitments ("I will...") unless the agent is expected to do so.

Personality belongs in role and mission. Treat it as a decision tiebreaker when instructions are ambiguous.

Good personality guidance:

- Defines what excellence looks like for the role
- Describes concrete behaviors, not abstract virtues
- Avoids vague escape-hatch language like "be pragmatic"

Template:

```markdown
You are [role identity] who [what excellence looks like in practice].

You [concrete positive behavior].
You [concrete positive behavior].
You [concrete positive behavior].
```

```markdown
You are a security-focused reviewer who identifies vulnerabilities
before they reach production.

You examine code changes through an attacker's lens, considering how
inputs could be manipulated. You distinguish between theoretical risks
and exploitable vulnerabilities, prioritizing findings by real-world
impact. You provide specific, actionable remediation guidance — not
vague warnings.
```

## 2. Scope and non-goals

Prevents the agent from accidentally overreaching. Useful when tool permissions are broad or the task description could be interpreted widely.

```markdown
## Scope
- Review code changes in the current PR for security vulnerabilities
- Check for common OWASP top-10 issues
- Verify authentication and authorization patterns

## Non-goals
- Code style or formatting issues (handled by linter)
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Refactoring recommendations
```

**Keep specialist prompts self-contained:** Specialist Sub Agent prompts should not reference other Sub Agents by name. This keeps them reusable and decoupled. If a specialist needs workflow context, the coordinator should provide it when delegating, not in the permanent prompt.

## 3. Operating principles

Use a mix of direct requirements and suggestions:

- **Direct requirements** (must/never) for correctness and safety
- **Suggestions** (prefer/consider) where multiple strategies can work

```markdown
## Operating principles
- Clarify before proceeding: if instructions are ambiguous, surface
  what's unclear rather than filling gaps with assumptions
- Weigh sources appropriately: official docs and established patterns
  take precedence over examples or inferred conventions
- Model downstream effects: before making a change, consider what it
  could break and what constraints it might conflict with
- Match confidence to certainty: if multiple valid approaches exist,
  present them with tradeoffs rather than silently picking one
```

Guidance:
- Prefer "Do X" over "It's good to X"
- Provide a default path and an escape hatch
- Avoid long background explanations unless they change behavior

### Prompt strictness: the "Goldilocks zone"

Prompt instructions should be specific enough to guide behavior but general enough to handle unexpected inputs.

| Problem | Symptom | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Too rigid** | Brittle enumeration that breaks on novel cases | "If .ts do X. If .tsx do Y. If .js do Z..." |
| **Too vague** | Abstract principles without actionable signals | "Be helpful and thorough." |
| **Just right** | Generalizable heuristics with clear escalation | "Prioritize correctness over style. When uncertain, ask." |

Match strictness to task risk:

| Strictness level | Task characteristics | Prompt approach |
|---|---|---|
| **High freedom** | Open-ended research, brainstorming, reviews | Heuristics + output guidelines |
| **Medium** | Structured workflows, data transformations | Step sequence + required checks |
| **Low (strict)** | Sensitive or high-impact operations | Explicit commands + validation loops |

## 4. Workflow checklist

Checklists are more reliable than prose instructions. Write steps the agent can follow:

```markdown
## Workflow
- [ ] Gather context (relevant files, requirements, constraints)
- [ ] Identify issues and opportunities
- [ ] Propose actions (or implement, depending on scope)
- [ ] Validate (tests, checks, sanity verification)
- [ ] Return findings in the output format
```

## 5. Tool-use policy

Make tool usage explicit — which tools to prefer, in what order, and what to avoid:

```markdown
## Tool policy
- Use the knowledge base tool before making assessments
- For data lookups, use the search tool with specific queries
- Report only relevant results — don't dump full tool outputs
- Do not execute code from untrusted sources
```

## 6. Output format

The output format is the most important section for multi-agent integration. If a coordinator aggregates results from multiple specialists, the output format is a shared interface. Define it precisely:

- **Exact headings** the output must include
- **Severity levels** or categories for findings
- **Evidence expectations** (line numbers, file paths, short excerpts)
- **Verbosity bounds** (e.g., "max 1-2 screens unless asked for more")

```markdown
## Output format

Return findings in this format:

### TL;DR (2-5 bullets)

### Findings (prioritized)
For each finding:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **File**: path/to/file.ts:line
- **Issue**: one-sentence description
- **Evidence**: relevant code excerpt (keep short)
- **Recommendation**: specific fix

### Recommended next actions
1. [highest priority action]
2. [second priority action]

### Open questions
- [only list what materially affects next steps]
```

## 7. Uncertainty and escalation

Define when the agent should ask for help vs proceed with assumptions:

```markdown
## Escalation rules
- **Ask** when: requirements are ambiguous and the choice materially
  affects the outcome
- **Proceed with assumptions** when: the decision is low-stakes and
  reversible; label assumptions explicitly
- **Return partial results** when: blocked on external dependency or
  missing information; include what you have and what's needed
```

## 8. Few-shot examples (optional)

- 2-3 well-chosen examples outperform more
- Order matters: place the most representative example last (recency effect)
- One weak example degrades all examples — curate carefully
