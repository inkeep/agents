sidebarTitle: Failure Modes
description: A catalog of systematic LLM failure modes and concrete techniques to guard against them in agent prompts. Select the 3-5 most relevant for your agent type.
---

LLMs have systematic failure modes — predictable ways they deviate from skilled human judgment. Good agent prompts explicitly name the failure modes most relevant to the task, giving the agent self-correction targets.

This is the difference between "what to do" and "what to watch out for."

## How to use this catalog

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Review the failure modes below
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Identify the **3-5 most likely** given your agent's task and scope
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Include them in the agent prompt — either as a dedicated section or woven into operating principles
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Frame as specific, observable behaviors — not vague admonitions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Don't include all of them. Selecting the relevant subset focuses attention where it matters. Including too many dilutes their effectiveness.

## The catalog

### 1. Plowing through ambiguity

**What it looks like:** Makes silent assumptions, fills gaps with defaults, never surfaces "I'm unclear on X." Proceeds confidently when it should pause.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Recognizing ambiguity or underspecification and clarifying before proceeding.

**Guard against it:**
- "If instructions are ambiguous or underspecified, surface what's unclear and ask — don't fill gaps silently"
- "State assumptions explicitly when you make them. Prefer asking over assuming when stakes are non-trivial"

### 2. Flattening nuance in sources

**What it looks like:** Treats ambiguous or conflicting content as definitive. Picks one interpretation and runs with it without acknowledging alternatives or tensions.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Balanced interpretation; acknowledging that sources may be ambiguous, incomplete, or in tension with each other.

**Guard against it:**
- "When sources conflict or are ambiguous, note the tension rather than silently picking one interpretation"
- "Distinguish what a source clearly states from what you're inferring or extrapolating"

### 3. Treating all sources as equally authoritative

**What it looks like:** Fails to weigh credibility, recency, or contextual fit. Applies information out of domain. Treats a blog comment the same as official documentation.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Evaluating source authority, applicability to the current situation, and domain fit.

**Guard against it:**
- "Weigh sources by authority and relevance: official docs > established codebase patterns > examples > blog posts > guesses"
- "Note when you're applying information outside its original context or domain"

### 4. Acting without modeling downstream effects

**What it looks like:** Misses edge cases. Fails to anticipate how an action or recommendation could backfire, conflict with other constraints, or cause unintended consequences.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Thinking through "what could go wrong" and "what else does this affect" before acting.

**Guard against it:**
- "Before making a change or recommendation, consider: what could this break? What edge cases exist? What constraints might this conflict with?"
- "If an action has non-obvious downstream consequences, name them explicitly"

### 5. Confabulating past knowledge limits

**What it looks like:** Generates plausible-sounding answers when the honest response is "I don't know." Fills knowledge gaps with fabrication rather than acknowledging uncertainty.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Knowing when you've hit a limitation of your knowledge and being honest about it.

**Guard against it:**
- "If you don't know or aren't confident, say so. 'I don't know' and 'I'm not certain about this' are valid responses"
- "Don't invent details to fill gaps. Flag what you'd need to verify"

### 6. Never escalating or deferring

**What it looks like:** Always produces an answer or takes an action rather than flagging "this needs human judgment" or "I'm not confident enough to proceed here."

**The human instinct it lacks:** Knowing when to escalate, defer, or bring in someone with more context or authority.

**Guard against it:**
- "If a decision is outside your scope, confidence level, or competence, say so and recommend escalation rather than guessing"
- "It's better to flag uncertainty than to proceed and cause harm or waste effort"

### 7. Treating all instructions as equally rigid

**What it looks like:** Fails to distinguish hard requirements from soft guidance. Either over-complies (treats suggestions as mandates) or over-interprets (treats mandates as flexible).

**The human instinct it lacks:** Parsing directive strength — knowing what's non-negotiable vs guidance vs suggestion.

**Guard against it:**
- "Distinguish 'must' (non-negotiable) from 'should' (strong default, exceptions possible) from 'consider' (suggestion, use judgment)"
- "If something says 'consider X,' you can decide not to do X with good reason. If something says 'always X,' you cannot skip it"

### 8. Assuming intent instead of probing

**What it looks like:** Projects a goal onto the user rather than understanding their actual mental model, intent, and constraints. Fills in "what they probably want" without checking.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Working with others to understand their goals and the nuance of what they actually want.

**Guard against it:**
- "Don't assume you know what they want. If intent is unclear or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask"
- "When in doubt, restate your understanding of the goal and verify it matches theirs before proceeding"

### 9. Asserting confidently when uncertain

**What it looks like:** Gives a single answer or takes a single path when multiple valid options exist. Under-hedges when the situation warrants presenting alternatives.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Calibrating confidence to actual certainty; presenting options when genuinely uncertain.

**Guard against it:**
- "When multiple valid approaches exist, present them with tradeoffs rather than silently picking one"
- "Match your expressed confidence to your actual certainty. Don't assert what you're genuinely unsure about"

### 10. Padding, repeating, and burying the lede

**What it looks like:** Restates points in slightly different words. Adds filler phrases. Scatters key details instead of surfacing them clearly.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Writing with a theory of mind — progressive, non-repetitive, focused on what the reader needs.

**Guard against it:**
- "State each point once, clearly. Don't rephrase the same idea in multiple places"
- "Lead with the most important information. Structure output for the reader's needs, not for completeness"
- "Before finalizing output, ask: what does the reader need to take away? Is that clear and prominent?"

### 11. Over-indexing on recency

**What it looks like:** Treats the latest input as overriding all prior context. Makes disproportionate adjustments based on recent feedback without weighing it against original intent.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Evaluating new inputs proportionally; maintaining awareness of full history and original intent.

**Guard against it:**
- "New input is additional context, not a reset. Weigh it against what's already been established"
- "If new feedback contradicts earlier guidance, surface the tension rather than silently overriding"

### 12. Clarification loop paralysis

**What it looks like:** Asks too many questions before acting. Seeks permission for low-stakes, reversible decisions. Creates friction by over-asking when sensible defaults exist.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Judging when to ask vs when to proceed with reasonable assumptions.

**Guard against it:**
- "For low-stakes, reversible decisions, proceed with sensible defaults and label your assumptions"
- "Ask only when: (1) the decision materially affects the outcome, (2) multiple valid approaches exist with different tradeoffs, or (3) the user's preference is genuinely unclear and stakes are non-trivial"

### 13. Silent assumption cascade

**What it looks like:** Makes a chain of assumptions without surfacing any of them. Each assumption builds on the previous, leading to outputs based on premises the user never agreed to.

**The human instinct it lacks:** Making assumptions visible so they can be challenged.

**Guard against it:**
- "When you make assumptions, state them explicitly: 'Assuming X, I will Y'"
- "If you've made multiple assumptions in a row, pause and surface them before proceeding further"

## Integrating failure modes into prompts

### Option A: Dedicated section

Add a "Failure modes to avoid" section in the agent prompt:

```markdown
## Failure modes to avoid

- **Plowing through ambiguity:** Don't fill gaps with silent
  assumptions. If requirements or context are unclear, surface
  what's missing and ask.
- **Flattening nuance:** Don't treat conflicting or ambiguous
  sources as definitive. Acknowledge tensions and uncertainties.
- **Padding and burying the lede:** Don't rephrase the same point
  multiple ways. Lead with what matters most; cut filler.
```

### Option B: Woven into operating principles

Integrate failure mode awareness into the operating principles:

```markdown
## Operating principles

- Clarify before proceeding: if instructions or context are
  ambiguous, surface what's unclear rather than filling gaps with
  assumptions.
- Weigh sources appropriately: official docs and established
  patterns take precedence. Note when sources conflict.
- Match confidence to certainty: if multiple valid approaches
  exist, present them with tradeoffs.
```

### Option C: Hybrid

Use operating principles for the positive framing, then add a brief callout:

```markdown
## Operating principles
...

**Watch out for:** silent assumptions when context is unclear;
flattening nuance in ambiguous sources; burying key findings in
verbose output.
```

## Why this works

Naming failure modes explicitly works because:

1. **Self-correction targets** — the agent knows what to watch for, not just what to do
2. **Concrete behaviors** — "Don't fill gaps silently" is actionable; "be careful" is not
3. **Contextual relevance** — selecting the right 3-5 focuses attention where it matters
4. **Matches human training** — skilled humans learn "here's how people mess this up" alongside "here's how to do it"
