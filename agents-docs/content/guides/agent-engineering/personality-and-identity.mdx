description: Write effective role and mission statements for AI agents — declare what excellence looks like, avoid escape hatches, and calibrate tradeoff language.
---

A personality statement gives the agent a **north star** when instructions are ambiguous. It answers: "What would the best version of this role do here?"

Done well, it pre-biases the agent toward excellent judgment. Done poorly, it gives the agent license to cut corners or over-apply rules.

## The asymmetry principle

LLMs over-generalize. Any escape hatch you provide will be used — often in contexts you didn't intend.

**Write personality that:**
- Declares what **great** looks like (the upside ceiling)
- Describes what the **best humans in this role** would do
- Is concrete about positive behaviors, not abstract virtues

**Avoid personality that:**
- Uses words that could excuse poor work ("pragmatic," "efficient," "fast," "good enough")
- Implies acceptable failures without clear anti-pattern framing
- Is so vague it could justify any behavior ("helpful," "smart," "thorough")

## Structure of a good personality statement

```
You are [role identity] who [what excellence looks like in practice].

You [concrete positive behavior].
You [concrete positive behavior].
You [concrete positive behavior — can include safe tradeoff].
```

### Examples

**Security reviewer:**

```markdown
You are a security-focused reviewer who identifies vulnerabilities
before they reach production.

You examine code changes through an attacker's lens, considering how
inputs could be manipulated. You distinguish between theoretical risks
and exploitable vulnerabilities, prioritizing findings by real-world
impact. You provide specific, actionable remediation guidance — not
vague warnings.
```

**Implementation agent:**

```markdown
You are a careful implementer who writes code that works correctly
the first time.

You understand the requirement fully before writing code. You handle
edge cases and error conditions, not just the happy path. You write
code that the next developer can read and modify confidently.
```

**Code reviewer:**

```markdown
You are a reviewer who catches the issues that matter most.

You focus on correctness, security, and maintainability over stylistic
preferences. You provide specific, actionable feedback with clear
rationale. You calibrate feedback intensity to issue severity —
critical issues get emphasis, minor suggestions stay brief.
```

**Research agent:**

```markdown
You are a researcher who finds accurate, relevant information
efficiently.

You verify claims against primary sources when stakes are high. You
distinguish between established facts, reasonable inferences, and
speculation. You surface what's most relevant to the question over
exhaustive coverage.
```

## Safe vs risky tradeoffs

Tradeoff language ("X over Y") can be effective — but only when Y is **clearly an anti-pattern** that good judgment would also deprioritize.

### Safe tradeoffs (Y is an anti-pattern)

| Statement | Why it's safe |
|---|---|
| "Focus on issues that matter over cosmetic nitpicks" | Cosmetic nitpicks are genuinely low-value |
| "Provide actionable findings over vague concerns" | Vague concerns are genuinely unhelpful |
| "Understand the requirement fully over jumping straight to code" | Jumping straight to code is genuinely an anti-pattern |
| "Return concise findings over exhaustive dumps" | Exhaustive dumps are genuinely unhelpful |

### Risky tradeoffs (Y is actually valuable)

| Statement | Why it's risky |
|---|---|
| "Ship working code over perfect code" | "Perfect code" isn't an anti-pattern; this licenses sloppiness |
| "Move fast over being thorough" | Thoroughness is valuable; this licenses rushing |
| "Prioritize speed over correctness" | Correctness is valuable; this licenses bugs |
| "Be concise over being complete" | Completeness is valuable; this licenses omissions |

### The tradeoff test

Before using "X over Y" language, ask:

> "Would the best human in this role also deprioritize Y? Is Y genuinely an anti-pattern, or just sometimes inconvenient?"

If Y is sometimes the right choice, don't frame it as a tradeoff. Instead, provide guidance on *when* to choose each approach.

## The "best human" test

Before finalizing a personality statement, ask:

> "If the best human in this role read this description, would they nod in recognition — or wince at a caricature?"

- The best security reviewers don't "miss nitpicks" — they triage effectively
- The best implementers don't "ship over polish" — they scope appropriately and deliver quality
- The best reviewers don't "avoid details" — they focus attention where it matters

If your personality statement sounds like a shortcut rather than excellence, revise it.

## Common failure modes

### 1. Vague virtue statements

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| "You are helpful, thorough, and careful" | "You identify the issues that would cause the most user pain and flag them clearly" |

These don't guide behavior — they're too abstract to shape decisions.

### 2. Escape-hatch language

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| "You are pragmatic and focus on what matters most" | "You address correctness and security issues completely; you note style issues briefly without blocking on them" |

"Pragmatic" and "what matters most" are infinitely interpretable.

### 3. Caricature personalities

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| "You are an obsessive perfectionist who catches every possible issue" | "You catch the issues that would cause real problems in production. You calibrate effort to impact" |

Caricatures encourage over-flagging and nitpicking.

### 4. Conflicting signals

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| "You are fast and thorough. You move quickly but never miss important details" | "You focus your time on high-impact areas. In those areas, you are thorough. Outside them, you note concerns briefly and move on" |

Conflicting goals force the agent to pick one arbitrarily.

## When personality conflicts with instructions

Personality is a **tiebreaker for ambiguous situations**, not an override for explicit guidance.

Make this hierarchy explicit in the agent prompt when needed:

```markdown
When instructions are specific, follow them exactly.
When instructions are ambiguous, use your judgment as [role] would.
```

## Integrating personality with the rest of the prompt

Personality belongs in the **Role and mission** section (first 2-4 sentences). It sets the frame for everything that follows:

- **Scope and non-goals** — boundaries that personality operates within
- **Workflow** — concrete steps that personality informs but doesn't override
- **Output contract** — structure that channels personality into useful outputs
- **Guardrails** — explicit rules that take precedence over personality-based judgment

A well-written agent prompt has personality and structure working together: personality guides judgment in gaps; structure ensures consistency in outputs.
