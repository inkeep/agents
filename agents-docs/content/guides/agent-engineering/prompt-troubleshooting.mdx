If your Sub Agent gives weak or inconsistent results, you usually do not need a full prompt rewrite. Start by matching symptoms, apply one targeted prompt fix, and testing again.

## Quick symptom picker

| If you see this | Start with |
|---|---|
| Silent assumptions or over-questioning | [Ambiguity and assumptions](#ambiguity-and-assumptions) |
| Conflicting sources handled poorly | [Evidence and source quality](#evidence-and-source-quality) |
| No escalation when blocked | [Decision boundaries and risk](#decision-boundaries-and-risk) |
| Long, repetitive responses with buried findings | [Output clarity and structure](#output-clarity-and-structure) |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ambiguity">
```markdown
- If requirements are ambiguous and the decision is high impact, ask before proceeding.
- For low-risk, reversible decisions, proceed with labeled assumptions.
- If assumptions materially affect outcomes, list them explicitly.
- If new input conflicts with prior constraints, surface the conflict before proceeding.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Evidence">
```markdown
- When sources conflict, state the conflict and provide options with tradeoffs.
- Separate direct evidence from inference.
- Prioritize sources: official docs -> established repo patterns -> examples -> blog posts.
- Call out when applying guidance outside its original context.
- If confidence is low, say "I don't know" and state what must be verified.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Boundaries">
```markdown
- Before acting, check: what could this break and who depends on it?
- Escalate when requests are out of scope, low-confidence/high-impact, or blocked by permissions.
- Define directive strength: must (non-negotiable), should (strong default), consider (optional).
- When multiple valid paths exist, present options with tradeoffs.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Output shape">
```markdown
- Return output in a strict format with ordered headings.
- Lead with 2-5 key bullets, then details.
- Avoid long preambles and repeated phrasing.
```

## Common issues and fixes

### Ambiguity and assumptions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent assumes missing details and proceeds">
    **What you see:** Silent assumptions, fabricated defaults, no clarification.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt says what to do, but not when to pause and ask.

    **Fix:**
    - Add: "If requirements are ambiguous and the decision is high impact, ask before proceeding."
    - Add: "If you proceed with assumptions, state them explicitly."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The agent asks too many clarifying questions">
    **What you see:** Repeated low-stakes questions and slow progress on reversible decisions.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define when asking is required versus optional.

    **Fix:**
    - Add ask policy: ask only for high-impact ambiguity or preference-sensitive decisions.
    - Add proceed policy: for low-risk decisions, proceed with labeled assumptions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The agent overreacts to the most recent message">
    **What you see:** New feedback causes the agent to ignore earlier goals and constraints.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not include continuity guidance.

    **Fix:**
    - Add: "New input adds context; it does not erase prior requirements."
    - Add: "If new input conflicts with prior constraints, surface the conflict before proceeding."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assumptions compound without visibility">
    **What you see:** Output depends on multiple hidden assumptions that were never validated.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not require explicit assumption disclosure.

    **Fix:**
    - Add: "When assumptions affect outcome, list them explicitly before final recommendations."
    - Add: "If assumptions stack, pause and request confirmation before further work."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Evidence and source quality

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent flattens nuance across conflicting sources">
    **What you see:** Conflicting sources are treated as agreement; alternatives are not named.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not explain how to handle ambiguous or conflicting evidence.

    **Fix:**
    - Add: "When sources conflict, state the conflict and provide options with tradeoffs."
    - Add: "Separate direct evidence from inference."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The agent treats weak sources as equally authoritative">
    **What you see:** Low-trust examples are used instead of official docs or established repo patterns.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define source priority.

    **Fix:**
    - Add source priority guidance, for example: official docs -> established repo patterns -> examples -> blog posts.
    - Add: "Call out when applying guidance outside its original context."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The agent invents details when uncertain">
    **What you see:** Plausible but unverified claims are presented confidently.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not allow uncertainty language, so the agent guesses.

    **Fix:**
    - Add: "'I don't know' is valid when confidence is low."
    - Add: "Do not invent missing details; state what must be verified."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Decision boundaries and risk

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent never escalates">
    **What you see:** The agent tries to answer everything, including out-of-scope decisions.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define escalation boundaries.

    **Fix:**
    - Add explicit escalation criteria: out-of-scope requests, low confidence on high-impact decisions, missing permissions.
    - Add expected escalation output: what is blocked, why, and what is needed to continue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The agent misreads directive strength">
    **What you see:** Suggestions are treated as requirements, or hard requirements are ignored.

    **Why it happens:** Directive strength is not defined consistently.

    **Fix:**
    - Define terms once: `must` = non-negotiable, `should` = strong default, `consider` = optional.
    - Rewrite ambiguous constraints to use one of those terms consistently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The agent presents one option only">
    **What you see:** One option is presented even when multiple valid options exist.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not require tradeoff framing when uncertainty is high.

    **Fix:**
    - Add: "When multiple valid options exist, present options with tradeoffs."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Output clarity and structure

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent is verbose, repetitive, or buries key points">
    **What you see:** Long preambles, repeated phrasing, and key findings that are hard to locate.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define a clear output shape.

    **Fix:**
    - Add a strict output format with ordered headings.
    - Add verbosity limits, for example: "Lead with 2-5 key bullets, then details."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Adding fixes to your prompt

You can add these guardrails in three ways. If you are new to prompt writing, start with Option A.

### Option A: Dedicated troubleshooting section

```markdown
## Prompt pitfalls to avoid

- If requirements are unclear on a high-impact decision, ask before proceeding.
- When sources conflict, acknowledge the conflict and separate evidence from inference.
- Lead with key findings and avoid repeated wording.
```

### Option B: Weave fixes into operating principles

```markdown
## Operating principles

- Clarify before action on high-impact ambiguity.
- Weigh evidence by source authority and relevance.
- Match confidence to certainty and provide options when needed.
```

### Option C: Hybrid

Use operating principles for defaults, then add a short "watch-outs" block near the end of the prompt.
