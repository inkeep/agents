description: Fix common Sub Agent prompt issues.
---

If your Sub Agent gives weak or inconsistent results, you usually do not need a full prompt rewrite. Start by matching what you see to a common issue, apply one small fix, and test again.

## How to use this page 

1. Find the issue that best matches what you are seeing.
2. Read the likely prompt cause to understand why it happens.
3. Copy one prompt fix into your prompt.
4. Re-run the same task 2-3 times.
5. Keep the fix if it helps, and remove it if it does not.

## Common prompt issues and fixes

### 1. The agent assumes missing details and proceeds

**Symptoms:** The agent makes silent assumptions, fabricates defaults, and proceeds without clarifying missing details.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt says what to do, but it does not say when to pause and ask questions.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add: "If requirements are ambiguous and the decision is high impact, ask before proceeding."
- Add: "If you proceed with assumptions, state them explicitly."

### 2. The agent flattens nuance across conflicting sources

**Symptoms:** The agent treats conflicting sources as if they agree and picks one interpretation without naming alternatives.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not explain how to handle conflicting or ambiguous evidence.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add: "When sources conflict, state the conflict and provide options with tradeoffs."
- Add: "Separate direct evidence from inference."

### 3. The agent treats weak sources as equally authoritative

**Symptoms:** The agent relies on low-trust examples instead of official docs or established codebase patterns.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not define a source-priority order.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add source priority guidance, for example: official docs -> established repo patterns -> examples -> blog posts.
- Add: "Call out when applying guidance outside its original context."

### 4. The agent misses downstream effects

**Symptoms:** The change looks reasonable in one place, but it causes unexpected breakage elsewhere.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not require a pre-change blast-radius check.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add a pre-action checklist: "What could this break? Which consumers depend on this?"
- Add: "For risky changes, include side effects and mitigation steps in the response."

### 5. The agent invents details when uncertain

**Symptoms:** The agent makes plausible but unverified claims and sounds confident without evidence.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not allow uncertainty language, so the agent feels pressure to guess.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add: "'I don't know' is valid when confidence is low."
- Add: "Do not invent missing details; state what must be verified."

### 6. The agent never escalates

**Symptoms:** The agent tries to answer everything, including decisions outside its scope or authority.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not define escalation boundaries.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add explicit escalation criteria: out-of-scope requests, low confidence on high-impact decisions, missing permissions.
- Add expected escalation output: what is blocked, why, and what is needed to continue.

### 7. The agent misreads directive strength

**Symptoms:** The agent treats suggestions as hard requirements, or it ignores non-negotiable requirements.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not clearly define directive strength.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Define terms once: `must` = non-negotiable, `should` = strong default, `consider` = optional.
- Rewrite ambiguous constraints to use one of those terms consistently.

### 8. The agent presents one path with overconfidence

**Symptoms:** The agent presents one recommendation even when multiple valid options exist.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not require tradeoff framing when uncertainty is high.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add: "When multiple valid paths exist, present options with tradeoffs."
- Add confidence calibration guidance: "Match certainty of wording to certainty of evidence."

### 9. The agent is verbose, repetitive, or buries key points

**Symptoms:** The response has long preambles, repeated phrasing, and key findings that are hard to locate.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not define a clear output shape.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add a strict output format with ordered headings.
- Add verbosity limits, for example: "Lead with 2-5 key bullets, then details."

### 10. The agent asks too many clarifying questions

**Symptoms:** The agent asks repeated low-stakes questions and makes slow progress on reversible decisions.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not define when asking is required versus optional.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add ask policy: ask only for high-impact ambiguity or preference-sensitive decisions.
- Add proceed policy: for low-risk decisions, proceed with labeled assumptions.

### 11. The agent overreacts to the most recent message

**Symptoms:** New feedback causes the agent to ignore earlier goals and constraints.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not include continuity guidance.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add: "New input adds context; it does not erase prior requirements."
- Add: "If new input conflicts with prior constraints, surface the conflict before proceeding."

### 12. Assumptions compound without visibility

**Symptoms:** The output depends on multiple hidden assumptions that were never validated.

**Likely prompt cause:** The prompt does not require explicit assumption disclosure.

**Prompt fixes:**
- Add: "When assumptions affect outcome, list them explicitly before final recommendations."
- Add: "If assumptions stack, pause and request confirmation before further work."

## Adding fixes to your prompt

You can add these guardrails in three ways. If you are new to prompt writing, start with Option A.

### Option A: Dedicated troubleshooting section (easiest)

```markdown
## Prompt pitfalls to avoid

- If requirements are unclear on a high-impact decision, ask before proceeding.
- When sources conflict, acknowledge the conflict and separate evidence from inference.
- Lead with key findings and avoid repeated wording.
```

### Option B: Weave fixes into operating principles

```markdown
## Operating principles

- Clarify before action on high-impact ambiguity.
- Weigh evidence by source authority and relevance.
- Match confidence to certainty and provide options when needed.
```

### Option C: Hybrid

Use operating principles for defaults, then add a short "watch-outs" block near the end of the prompt.
