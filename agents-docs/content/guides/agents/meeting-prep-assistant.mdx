## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll build a meeting prep assistant agent using the Inkeep Visual Builder. When you ask "Can you help me prep for my upcoming Acme meeting?", the agent will:
1. Look up the meeting in your Google Calendar
2. Search the web to research the company
3. Present a comprehensive meeting prep summary

## Adding MCP tools

To enable your agent to access Google Calendar and perform web research, you'll need to add MCP tools. We'll use Zapier MCP, which provides pre-built MCP servers for many popular services.

<Tip>
Learn more on how to create MCP servers in our [MCP Servers guide](/guides/mcp-servers/overview).
</Tip>

### Step 1: Create a Google Calendar MCP server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a Zapier MCP account [here](https://zapier.com/mcp).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **+ New MCP Server** in the top right corner. When prompted to select an MCP Client, choose **Other**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **+ Add Tool** and select **Google Calendar**. Then select the **Find Events** tool, click **Connect**, and complete the OAuth flow to authorize access.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the **Connect** tab and copy the **Server URL**. You'll need this to register the tool in the Visual Builder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Register MCP servers in Visual Builder

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In the Visual Builder, go to the **MCP Servers** tab in the left sidebar, then select **+ New MCP Server**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select **Custom Server** and enter the Server URL you copied from Zapier. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Google Calendar"), and for **Credential**, select **No Authentication**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Save** to register the Google Calendar server.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Repeat the same process for the Exa MCP Server. The MCP Server URL is https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect tools to sub agents

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the agent canvas: **Agents** > **Meeting prep agent**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Drag and drop an **MCP** block from the top left toolbar onto the canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the **Google Calendar MCP** tool and connect it to the **Meeting Finder** sub agent.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add another MCP block, select the **Exa MCP** tool, and connect it to the **Company Research** sub agent.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Save Changes** in the top right corner to save your configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing your agent

Ensure you have at least one upcoming meeting with an external company on your Google Calendar. If you don't have one, create a test meeting.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **Try it** in the top right corner to open the chat interface.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Test your agent by asking: "Can you help me prep for my upcoming [company name] meeting?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

When working correctly, the agent will:
1. Find the meeting in your Google Calendar
2. Research the company using Exa
3. Present a comprehensive meeting prep summary
