## Overview

OpenAI AgentKit provides strong UI components (ChatKit) and basic agent building, but limits you to OpenAI models with manual knowledge management. Inkeep offers multi-agent orchestration, 2-way code-UI sync, automated knowledge ingestion, multi-provider support, and enterprise-grade content intelligence.
