## Overview

This guide provides a structured methodology for debugging problems across different components of your agent system.

## Step 1: Check the Timeline

The timeline is your first stop for understanding what happened during a conversation or agent execution. Navigate to the **Traces** sections to view in depth details per conversation. Within each conversation, you'll find an **error card** that is clickable whenever something goes wrong during agent execution. 

### What to Look For

- **Execution flow**: Review the sequence of agent actions and tool calls
- **Timing**: Check for delays or bottlenecks in the execution
- **Agent transitions**: Verify that transfers and delegations happened as expected
- **Tool usage**: Confirm that tools were called correctly and returned expected results
- **Error cards**: Look for red error indicators in the timeline and click to view detailed error information

### Error Cards in the Timeline

Clicking on this error card reveals:

- **Error type**: The specific category of error (e.g., "Agent Generation Error")
- **Exception stacktrace**: The complete stack trace showing exactly where the error occurred in the code

This detailed error information helps you pinpoint exactly what went wrong and where in your agent's execution chain.

## Step 2: Check Signoz

Signoz provides distributed tracing and observability for your agent system, offering deeper insights when the built-in timeline isn't sufficient.

### Accessing Signoz from the Timeline

You can easily access Signoz directly from the timeline view. In the **Traces** section, click on any activity in the conversation timeline to view its details. Within the activity details, you'll find a **"View in Signoz"** button that takes you directly to the corresponding span in Signoz for deeper analysis.

### What Signoz Shows

- **Distributed traces**: End-to-end request flows across services
- **Performance metrics**: Response times, throughput, and error rates

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Agent response times**: How long each agent takes to process requests
- **Tool execution times**: Performance of MCP servers and external APIs
- **Error rates**: Frequency and types of failures

## Agent Stopped Unexpectedly

### StopWhen Limits Reached

If your agent stops mid-conversation, it may have hit a configured stopWhen limit:

- **Transfer limit reached**: Check `transferCountIs` on your Agent or Project - agent stops after this many transfers between Sub Agents
- **Step limit reached**: Check `stepCountIs` on your Sub Agent or Project - execution stops after this many tool calls + LLM responses

**How to diagnose:**
- Check the timeline for the last activity before stopping
- Look for messages indicating limits were reached
- Review your stopWhen configuration in Agent/Project settings

**How to fix:**
- Increase the limits if legitimate use case requires more steps/transfers
- Optimize your agent flow to use fewer transfers
- Investigate if agent is stuck in a loop (limits working as intended)

See [Configuring StopWhen](/typescript-sdk/agent-settings#configuring-stopwhen) for more details.

## Common Configuration Issues

### General Configuration Issues

- **Missing environment variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
- **Incorrect API endpoints**: Verify you're using the right URLs
- **Network connectivity**: Check firewall and proxy settings
- **Version mismatches**: Ensure all packages are compatible

### MCP Server Connection Issues

- **MCP not able to connect**: 
    - Check that the MCP server is running and accessible
- **401 Unauthorized errors**:
    - Verify that credentials are properly configured and valid
- **Connection timeouts**:
    - Ensure network connectivity and firewall settings allow connections

### AI Provider Configuration Problems

- **AI Provider key not defined or invalid**: 
  - Ensure you have one of these environment variables set: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
  - Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits
  - Check that the key hasn't expired or been revoked

- **GPT-5 access issues**: 
  - Individual users cannot access GPT-5 as it requires organization verification
  - Use GPT-4 or other available models instead
  - Contact OpenAI support if you need GPT-5 access for your organization

### Credit and Rate Limiting Issues

- **Running out of credits**: 
  - Monitor your OpenAI usage and billing
  - Set up usage alerts to prevent unexpected charges

- **Rate limiting by AI providers**: 
  - Especially common with high-frequency operations like summarizers
  - Monitor your API usage patterns and adjust accordingly

### Context Fetcher Issues

- **Context fetcher timeouts**: 
  - Check that external services are responding within expected timeframes
