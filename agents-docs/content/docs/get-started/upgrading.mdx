- [`@inkeep/agents-run-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-run-api): The API for executing conversations with your agents.
- [`@inkeep/agents-manage-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-manage-ui): The UI for the visual builder and dashboard.
- [`@inkeep/agents-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-core): The core shared functionality of the agent framework.
- [`@inkeep/agents-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-sdk): The TypeScript SDK for building multi-agent systems.
- [`@inkeep/agents-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-cli): The CLI for managing and interacting with the agent framework.
- [`@inkeep/agents-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-ui): The UI library containing chat widget components.

## Upgrading the quickstart template

If you used the `npx @inkeep/create-agents` CLI command to create your workspace, run the following command from the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm upgrade-agents
```

This will update all the packages to the latest version and migrate your database schema to the latest version.

## Upgrading the Agent CLI

If you installed the `@inkeep/agents-cli` package globally, you can upgrade it to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
inkeep update
```
