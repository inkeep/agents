## Launch your first agent

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 10 or higher

You can verify your installations by running:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
```

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

First, create a new agents project.

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agent-directory 
```

Navigate to the new agents project.

```bash
cd my-agent-directory
```

### Step 2: Launch the dev environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Visual Builder automatically opens at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 3: Chat with your agent

Navigate to the Event Planner agent at http://localhost:3000, click **Try it**, and ask about fun activities at a location of your choice.

### Step 4: Install Agents MCP (optional)

To help with development, add the Inkeep docs MCP to your preferred IDE or MCP client. It has a few tools for "vibe coding" agents with the SDK.

**Quick Install:**

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '16px', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=inkeep-agents&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FnZW50cy5pbmtlZXAuY29tL21jcCJ9">
    <img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.png" alt="Add to Cursor" style={{ height: '40px' }} />
  </a>
  <a href="vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22inkeep-agents%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22sse%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fagents.inkeep.com%2Fmcp%22%7D">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Inkeep_Agents-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=ffffff" alt="Install in VS Code" />
  </a>
</div>

**Or configure manually** in your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inkeep-agents": {
      "url": "https://agents.inkeep.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Next steps

Next, we recommend learning about `inkeep push` and `inkeep pull` so you can go from `SDK -> Visual Builder` and `Visual Builder -> SDK`. See the [Push / Pull](/get-started/push-pull) guide for a quick example.
