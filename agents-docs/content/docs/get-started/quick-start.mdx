### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 10 or higher

You can verify your installations by running:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
```

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

First, create a new agents project.

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agent-directory
```

Navigate to the new agents project.

```bash
cd my-agent-directory
```

### Step 2: Launch the dev environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Visual Builder automatically opens at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 3: Chat with your agent

Navigate to the Event Planner agent at http://localhost:3000, click **Try it**, and ask about fun activities at a location of your choice.

### Step 4: Install Inkeep MCP (optional)

To help with development, add the `Inkeep Agents MCP` to your preferred IDE or MCP client. It has tools to help "vibe code" agents with the Inkeep SDK.

  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "16px",
  }}

    />
  </a>
  <a href="vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22inkeep-agents-mcp%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22sse%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fagents.inkeep.com%2Fmcp%22%7D">

      alt="Install in VS Code"
      style={{ height: "22px", verticalAlign: "middle" }}
    />
  </a>
</div>

To add to **Claude Code**, run this in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http inkeep-agents https://agents.inkeep.com/mcp --scope project
```

Or manually add to any MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inkeep-agents": {
      "url": "https://agents.inkeep.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Next steps

Next, we recommend learning about `inkeep push` and `inkeep pull` so you can go from `SDK -> Visual Builder` and `Visual Builder -> SDK`. See the [Push / Pull](/get-started/push-pull) guide for a quick example.
