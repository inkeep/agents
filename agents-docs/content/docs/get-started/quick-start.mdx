## Launch your first agent

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 10 or higher

You can verify your installations by running:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
```

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

First, create a new agents project.

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agent-directory 
```

Navigate to the new agents project.

```bash
cd my-agent-directory
```

### Step 2: Launch the dev environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Visual Builder automatically opens at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 3: Chat with your agent

Navigate to the Event Planner agent at http://localhost:3000, click "Try It", and ask about fun activities at a location of your choice.

### Next steps

Next, we recommend using `inkeep push` and `inkeep pull` to push your code to the no-code Visual Builder and pull the Visual Builder back to your code. See [Push / Pull](/get-started/push-pull) to get started.
