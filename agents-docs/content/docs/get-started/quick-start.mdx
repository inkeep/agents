## Launch your first agent

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22 or higher
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 10 or higher

You can verify by running:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
docker --version
```

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

Run the quickstart script on a target folder:

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agents
```

Navigate to the folder

```bash
cd my-agents
```

Open the folder using your favorite coding editor. To open with Cursor, you can run `cursor .` 

### Step 2: Run the setup script

Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker daemon) is running before running the setup script.

```bash
pnpm setup-dev
```

### Step 3: Launch the dev environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Visual Builder will auto-open at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 4: Chat with your agent

Navigate to the **Activities Planner** agent at http://localhost:3000, click **Try it**, and ask about fun activities at a location of your choice:

### Step 5: Install Inkeep MCP (optional)

To help "vibe code" agents with Inkeep, add the `Inkeep Agents MCP` to your preferred IDE.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "16px",
  }}
>
  <a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=inkeep-agents&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FnZW50cy5pbmtlZXAuY29tL21jcCJ9">
    <Image
      src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.png"
      alt="Add to Cursor"
      style={{ height: "32px", verticalAlign: "middle" }}
    />
  </a>
  <a href="vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22inkeep-agents-mcp%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22sse%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fagents.inkeep.com%2Fmcp%22%7D">
    <Image
      src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Inkeep_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=ffffff"
      alt="Install in VS Code"
      style={{ height: "22px", verticalAlign: "middle" }}
    />
  </a>
</div>

To add to **Claude Code**, run this in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http inkeep-agents https://agents.inkeep.com/mcp --scope project
```

Or manually add `https://agents.inkeep.com/mcp` as an MCP Server to any MCP client.

### Next steps

Next, we recommend learning about `inkeep push` and `inkeep pull` so you can go from `SDK -> Visual Builder` and `Visual Builder -> SDK`. See the [Push / Pull](/get-started/push-pull) guide for a quick example.
