## Overview

There are multiple ways to manage credentials for your agents, each with different security and convenience trade-offs:

1. **Nango Cloud**: Managed credential store with web interface
2. **Nango Local**: Self-hosted credential store using Docker
3. **Environment Variables**: Simple SDK-based approach using environment variables
4. **Keychain**: Secure local storage using your operating system's credential manager


## Option 3: Keychain (Bearer authentication)

You can also store bearer tokens in your operating system's Keychain by choosing Keychain Store as the credential store when creating a credential in the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/credentials). More information about Keychain Store can be found [here](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#keychain-store).

## Option 4: Environment variables

When using the SDK, you can create credentials that reference environment variables using the [Memory Store](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#memory-store). Follow the Basic Setup Example [here](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#basic-setup-example) to see how to set this up.
