## Overview

There are multiple ways to manage credentials for your agents, each with different security and convenience trade-offs:

1. **Nango Cloud**: Managed credential store with web interface
2. **Nango Local**: Self-hosted credential store using Docker
3. **Environment Variables**: Simple SDK-based approach using environment variables
4. **Keychain**: Secure local storage using your operating system's credential manager

## Option 1: Nango Cloud setup

### Step 1: Create a Nango account

Sign up [here](https://app.nango.dev/signin)

### Step 2: Save your Nango secret key

After creating your Nango account, navigate to Environment Settings in your dashboard and copy the secret key.

### Step 3: Configure your root `.env` file

```
NANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_nango_secret_key
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

1. Restart your Inkeep agents:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Create a new credential in the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/credentials)

## Option 2: Nango local setup

### Step 1: Clone the optional services repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agents-optional-local-dev
cd agents-optional-local-dev
```

### Step 2: Start Nango Services

Inside the `agents-optional-local-dev` repository, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose --profile nango up -d
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your **root project directory** (not inside the `agents-optional-local-dev` repository), update your `.env` file:

```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_nango_secret_key
NANGO_HOST=http://localhost:3050
PUBLIC_NANGO_CONNECT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3051
```

To get your Nango secret key:

1. Open Nango at `http://localhost:3050`
2. Navigate to Environment Settings and copy the secret key

### Step 4: Verify Setup

1. Restart your Inkeep agents:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Create a new credential in the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/credentials)

## Option 3: Keychain (Bearer authentication)

You can also store bearer tokens in your operating system's Keychain by choosing Keychain Store as the credential store when creating a credential in the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/credentials). More information about Keychain Store can be found [here](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#keychain-store).

## Option 4: Environment variables

When using the SDK, you can create credentials that reference environment variables using the [Memory Store](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#memory-store). Follow the Basic Setup Example [here](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#basic-setup-example) to see how to set this up.
