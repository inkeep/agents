## Push code to visual

With Inkeep, you can define your agents in code, push them to the Visual Builder, and continue developing with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. You can switch back to code any time.

Let's walk through the process.

### Step 1: Install the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 2: Download a template project

Navigate to the `src/projects` directory.

```bash
cd src/projects
```

Add the docs assistant agent using `inkeep add`. 

```bash
inkeep add --project docs-assistant
```

Find the downloaded code in `src/projects/docs-assistant`.

<Note> 
`inkeep add` imports a template project from our [cookbook library](https://github.com/inkeep/agents-cookbook/tree/main/template-projects) into your src/projects directory.
</Note>

### Step 3: Push code to visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep push` to push the code to the Visual Builder.

```bash
inkeep push
```

### Step 4: Chat with your agent

Refresh http://localhost:3000, switch to the **Docs Assistant** project (in the bottom left).

Under **Agents**, click on the Docs Assistant agent and press **Try it**. Ask a question about Inkeep.

## Run `inkeep pull`

Make some changes, like changing a prompt, and let's walk through `inkeep pull`. 

### Requirements

The `inkeep pull` command in-part leverages AI to sync your TypeScript files to the state of your Visual Builder, so **at least one** of the below environment variables to be defined:

```txt .env
# Choose one:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# or
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# or
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The CLI prioritizes Anthropic → OpenAI → Google. 

Here are the models used:

| Provider   | Model(s)                        | Where to Get API Key                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Anthropic  | Claude Sonnet 4.5 (extended thinking) | [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)     |
| OpenAI     | GPT-4.1                         | [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)         |
| Google     | Gemini models (with thinking mode) | [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)              |


### Step 1: Make an edit visually

Make an edit to the docs assistant agent in the UI, such as changing the prompt of the agent.

### Step 2: Pull code from visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd src/projects/docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep pull` to pull the code from the Visual Builder to your local project.

```bash
inkeep pull
```

### Step 3: Verify the code was pulled

Check the `src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts` file for the updated prompt.

```bash
cat src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts
```

## Next steps

Next, we recommend setting up observability to see live traces of your agent. See [Traces](/get-started/traces) to get started.
