## Push code to visual

With Inkeep, you can define your agents in code, push them to the Visual Builder, and continue developing with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. You can switch back to code any time.

Let's walk through the process.

  title="Using Inkeep push"
/>

### Step 1: Install the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 2: Download a template project

Navigate to the `src/projects` directory.

```bash
cd src/projects
```

Add the docs assistant agent using `inkeep add`.

```bash
inkeep add --project docs-assistant
```

Find the downloaded code in `src/projects/docs-assistant`.

<Tip> 
`inkeep add` imports a template project from our [cookbook library](https://github.com/inkeep/agents/tree/main/agents-cookbook/template-projects).
</Tip>

### Step 3: Push code to visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep push` to push the code to the Visual Builder.

```bash
inkeep push
```

<Tip>
To validate your project without pushing, use the `--json` flag: `inkeep push --json`
</Tip>

### Step 4: Chat with your agent

Refresh http://localhost:3000, switch to the **Docs Assistant** project (in the bottom left).

Under **Agents**, click on the Docs Assistant agent and press **Try it**. Ask a question about Inkeep.

## Run `inkeep pull`

Make some changes, like changing a prompt, and let's walk through `inkeep pull`.

<Snippet file="pull-prereq.mdx" />

### Step 1: Make an edit visually

Make an edit to the docs assistant agent in the UI, such as changing the prompt of the agent.

### Step 2: Pull code from visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd src/projects/docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep pull` to pull the code from the Visual Builder to your local project.

```bash
inkeep pull
```

### Step 3: Verify the code was pulled

Check the `src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts` file for the updated prompt.

```bash
cat src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts
```

## Next steps

Next, we recommend setting up observability to see live traces of your agent. See [Traces](/get-started/traces) to get started.
