## Push code to visual

With Inkeep, you can define your agents in code, push them to the Visual Builder, and continue developing with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. You can switch back to code any time.

Lets walk through the process.

### Step 1: Install the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 2: Download a template project

Navigate to the `src/projects` directory.

```bash
cd src/projects
```

Add the docs assistant agent using `inkeep add`. 

```bash
inkeep add docs-assistant
```

Find the downloaded code in `src/projects/docs-assistant`.

<Note> 
`inkeep add` imports a template project from our [cookbook library](https://github.com/inkeep/agents-cookbook/tree/main/template-projects) into your src/projects directory.
</Note>

### Step 3: Push code to visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd src/projects/docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep push` to push the code to the Visual Builder.

```bash
inkeep push
```

### Step 5: Chat with your agent

Refresh http://localhost:3000, switch to the **Docs Assistant** project (in the bottom left).

Under **Agents**, click on the Docs Assistant agent and press **Try it**. Ask a question about Inkeep.

## Pull code from visual

Make some changes, like changing a prompt, and lets walk through `inkeep pull`. The `inkeep pull` command uses AI to sync your TypeScript files to the state of your Visual Builder.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** urrently, we currently only support Anthropic. Support for other providers will be coming soon.

If you don't already have an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, you can get one from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).

Then add it to your `.env` file:
```txt .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

</Note>

### Step 1: Make an edit visually

Make an edit to the docs assistant agent in the UI, such as changing the prompt of the agent.

### Step 2: Pull code from visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd src/projects/docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep pull` to pull the code from the Visual Builder to your local project.

```bash
inkeep pull
```

### Step 3: Verify the code was pulled

Check the `src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts` file for the updated prompt.

```bash
cat src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts
```

## Next steps

Next, we recommend setting up observability to see live traces of your agent. See [Traces](/get-started/traces) to get started.
