## Overview

The Inkeep Agent Framework provides powerful **traces** and **live debugging** capabilities powered by SigNoz. Setting up SigNoz gives you:

- **Real-time trace visualization** - See exactly how your agents execute step-by-step
- **Live debugging** - Debug agent conversations as they happen
- **Export traces as JSON** - Copy complete traces for offline analysis and debugging
- **Full observability** - Complete OpenTelemetry instrumentation for monitoring
- **Performance insights** - Identify bottlenecks and optimize agent performance

## Setup Options

You can set up SigNoz in two ways:

1. **Cloud Setup**: Use SigNoz Cloud
2. **Local Setup**: Run SigNoz locally using Docker

## Option 1: SigNoz Cloud Setup

### Step 1: Create a SigNoz Cloud Project

1. Sign up at [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/teams/)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one

### Step 2: Save Your SigNoz Credentials

You'll need to collect three pieces of information from your SigNoz dashboard:

1. **API Key**:

   - Navigate to Settings → Workspace Settings → API Keys → New Key
   - Choose any role (Admin, Editor, or Viewer) - Viewer is sufficient for observability
   - Set the expiration field to "No Expiry" to prevent the key from expiring
   - Copy the generated API key

2. **Ingestion Key**:

   - Navigate to Settings → Workspace Settings → Ingestion
   - Set the expiration field to "No Expiry" to prevent the key from expiring
   - Copy the ingestion key

3. **SigNoz URL**:
   - Copy the URL from your browser's address bar
   - It will look like: `https://<your-organization>.signoz.cloud`

### Step 3: Configure Your Root `.env` File

```bash
# SigNoz
SIGNOZ_URL=https://<your-organization>.signoz.cloud
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```

### Step 4: Verify Cloud Setup

1. Restart your development environment:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Generate some traces by interacting with your agents

3. Open your SigNoz cloud dashboard and navigate to "Traces" to see your agent traces

## Option 2: Local SigNoz Setup

  title="Local SigNoz Setup steps"
/>

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

### Step 1: Clone the Optional Services Repository

Clone the Inkeep optional local development services repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agents-optional-local-dev
cd agents-optional-local-dev
```

### Step 2: Start SigNoz Services

Run the following command to start SigNoz and related services:

```bash
docker-compose --profile signoz up -d
```

This will start:

- SigNoz frontend (accessible at `http://localhost:3080`)
- SigNoz query service
- SigNoz OTEL collector
- ClickHouse database

When you visit `http://localhost:3080`, you can sign up with your desired credentials.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your **root project directory** (e.g., `my-agent-directory`), update your `.env` file:

```bash
# SigNoz Configuration
SIGNOZ_URL=http://localhost:3080
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=your-signoz-api-key

# IMPORTANT: Comment out the OTEL Configuration
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```

To get your SigNoz API key:

1. Open SigNoz at `http://localhost:3080`
2. Navigate to Settings → Account Settings → API Keys → New Key
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one.
   - Choose any role (Admin, Editor, or Viewer) - Viewer is sufficient for observability
   - Set the expiration field to "No Expiry" to prevent the key from expiring

### Step 4: Verify Setup

1. Restart your Inkeep agents:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Make some requests to your agents to generate traces

3. Open SigNoz at `http://localhost:3080` and navigate to the "Traces" section to see your agent traces

## Viewing Traces and Using the Live Debugger

Once SigNoz is set up, you can access traces and live debugging in two ways:

### 1. Visual Builder Traces Interface

If you're using the Visual Builder:

1. Open your agent project in the Visual Builder
2. Navigate to the **Traces** section
3. You'll see real-time traces of your agent executions
4. Click on any trace to see detailed execution flow and timing

The traces overview shows conversation metrics and recent activity:

Click on any conversation to see detailed execution flow:

/>

<Snippet file="copy-trace.mdx" />

### 2. SigNoz Dashboard

For detailed analysis and further debugging:

1. Open your SigNoz dashboard (cloud or local)
2. Navigate to **Traces** to see all agent executions
3. Use filters to find specific conversations or agents
4. Click on traces to see:
   - Step-by-step execution details
   - Performance metrics
   - Error information
   - Agent-to-agent communication flows

For more detailed information on using traces, see the [SigNoz Usage guide](/typescript-sdk/signoz-usage).

## Additional Observability and Evals

👉 For additional observability or a dedicated Evals platform, you can connect to any OTEL-based provider. For example, check out the [Langfuse Usage guide](/typescript-sdk/langfuse-usage) for end-to-end instructions.

## Next steps

Next, we recommend setting up the Nango credential store for production-ready credential management. See [Credentials](/typescript-sdk/credentials/overview) to get started.
