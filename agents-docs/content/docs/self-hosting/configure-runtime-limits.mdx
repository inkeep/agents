# Configure Runtime Limits

## Overview

The Inkeep Agent Framework includes sensible defaults for execution limits, timeouts, and constraints. However, certain use cases—like long-running orchestration agents—may require different configurations.

## How Runtime Configuration Works

### Two Types of Limits

**1. API-Configurable Limits** (set per agent/sub-agent via manage-api)
- Configured in your agent definitions using `stopWhen`
- Controls agent-specific behavior
- See [Agent Settings - StopWhen](/docs/typescript-sdk/agent-settings#configuring-stopwhen)

**2. Runtime Environment Limits** (set via environment variables)
- System-wide defaults and maximum allowed values
- Controls infrastructure-level constraints
- Documented in this guide

### Configuration Hierarchy

When an agent executes:
1. Uses agent-specific `stopWhen` settings if configured
2. Falls back to runtime environment defaults
3. Cannot exceed runtime environment maximums

### Understanding the Constants Architecture

The runtime environment limits are defined as TypeScript constants in the `@inkeep/agents-core` package. These constants are organized into two categories based on their purpose:

**1. Schema Validation Constants** (`packages/agents-core/src/constants/schema-validation/defaults.ts`)
- Define **API-level validation limits** (min, max, default values)
- Control what values users can configure via the manage-api
- Used in Zod schemas to validate agent configuration requests
- Examples: Transfer count limits, generation step limits, prompt character limits

**2. Runtime Execution Constants - Shared** (`packages/agents-core/src/constants/execution-limits-shared/defaults.ts`)
- Define **internal runtime behavior** limits
- Control infrastructure-level timeouts, retries, and constraints
- Shared across both manage-api and run-api services
- Examples: MCP connection timeouts, conversation history token limits

**3. Runtime Execution Constants - Run-API** (`packages/agents-run-api/src/constants/execution-limits/defaults.ts`)
- Define **run-api specific runtime behavior** limits
- Control execution engine timeouts, retries, and resource constraints
- Only used by the run-api service (not shared with manage-api)
- Examples: LLM generation timeouts, function tool sandbox limits, streaming buffer sizes

Each constant includes detailed inline documentation explaining its purpose, behavior, and impact on the runtime. **The TypeScript constant files are the source of truth** for default values and available overrides—not `.env.example`.

All constants can be overridden via environment variables prefixed with `AGENTS_`. For example:
```bash
# Override a schema validation constant
AGENTS_AGENT_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50

# Override a runtime execution constant
AGENTS_MCP_TOOL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
```

## Use Case: Long-Running Orchestration Agents

For agents that orchestrate complex workflows (like coding agents that run for hours), you'll want to increase various limits and timeouts.

### Recommended Configuration

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Agent Execution - Allow more sub-agent transfers for complex orchestration
AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50  # Default: 10
AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_MAX=2000    # Default: 1000

# Sub-Agent Turns - Allow more LLM generation steps per turn
AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_DEFAULT=30  # Default: 12
AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_MAX=2000    # Default: 1000

# LLM Timeouts - Increase for longer-running operations
AGENTS_LLM_GENERATION_FIRST_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS_STREAMING=600000   # 10min, Default: 4.5min
AGENTS_LLM_GENERATION_SUBSEQUENT_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS=180000        # 3min, Default: 1.5min

# Function Tools - Allow longer execution for complex operations
AGENTS_FUNCTION_TOOL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS_DEFAULT=120000  # 2min, Default: 30sec

# MCP Tools - Increase timeout for external tool operations
AGENTS_MCP_TOOL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_DEFAULT=180000  # 3min, Default: 1min

# Session Management - Keep tool results cached longer
AGENTS_SESSION_TOOL_RESULT_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000  # 30min, Default: 5min

# Streaming - Allow streams to run longer
AGENTS_STREAM_MAX_LIFETIME_MS=1800000  # 30min, Default: 10min
```

### Why These Settings?

- **Transfer Count**: Coding orchestration often involves many handoffs between specialist agents (planning → implementation → testing → refinement)
- **Generation Steps**: Each coding operation may require multiple tool calls (read files, analyze, write code, run tests)
- **Timeouts**: Code generation and analysis can take time, especially for large files or complex refactoring
- **Cache Duration**: Keeps tool results available throughout long sessions for artifact processing

## Setting Variables by Deployment Type

### Local Development (Docker Compose)

```bash
# Edit .env file
vim .env

# Add your overrides
AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50
# ... other settings

# Restart services
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

### Production Deployments

#### AWS EC2, GCP, Hetzner
Add variables to your `.env` file before running `docker compose up`:

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
# Edit .env with your overrides
vim .env
docker compose up -d
```

#### Vercel, Cloud Run, etc.
Set environment variables in your platform's environment configuration UI.

## All Available Configuration Variables

All runtime configuration variables are defined as TypeScript constants. To explore available overrides and their detailed documentation:

1. **View the constant files** (source of truth):
   - Schema validation constants: `packages/agents-core/src/constants/schema-validation/defaults.ts`
   - Runtime execution constants (shared): `packages/agents-core/src/constants/execution-limits-shared/defaults.ts`
   - Runtime execution constants (run-api): `packages/agents-run-api/src/constants/execution-limits/defaults.ts`
2. Each constant includes inline documentation explaining its purpose, behavior, and impact
3. Convert constant names to environment variables by prefixing with `AGENTS_`

### Configuration Categories

The runtime configuration is organized into functional categories:

**Schema Validation Constants** (API-level limits):
- **Agent Execution Transfer Count**: Limits transfers between sub-agents in a turn
- **Sub-Agent Turn Generation Steps**: LLM generation steps within a single sub-agent activation
- **Status Update Thresholds**: Event and time-based triggers for status updates
- **Prompt Validation**: Character limits for agent and sub-agent system prompts
- **Context Fetchers**: HTTP timeouts for external data fetching (CRM lookups, API calls)

**Runtime Execution Constants - Shared** (infrastructure-level limits):
- **MCP Tool Connection & Retry**: Connection timeouts and exponential backoff for MCP tools
- **Conversation History**: Token limits for conversation context windows

**Runtime Execution Constants - Run-API** (run-api service-specific limits):
- **LLM Generation Timeouts**: Timeout behavior for AI model calls
- **Function Tool Sandbox**: Execution limits for function tools in isolated sandboxes
- **Delegation & A2A**: Inter-agent communication settings
- **Artifact Processing**: UI component generation with retry mechanisms
- **Session Management**: Tool result caching and cleanup
- **Streaming**: Frequency, batching, and lifetime limits for streams
