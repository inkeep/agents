### Composio

[Composio](https://composio.dev/) offers a platform for building and managing MCP servers with access to 10,000+ pre-built tools and integrations.

#### Quick integration

Follow Composio's MCP Gateway setup to obtain your MCP server URL and credentials. Then register it as a tool in your project:

```typescript
import { mcpTool } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';

const composioTool = mcpTool({
  id: 'composio-tools',
  name: 'Composio Integration',
  description: 'Access popular SaaS tools via Composio',
  serverUrl: 'YOUR_COMPOSIO_MCP_URL', // From Composio dashboard
});
```
