MCP servers enable your agents to fetch real-time information and take action on your systems, services, and applications.

## Choose your approach

Select the option that best fits your needs:

- **Native MCP Servers** - Pre-built servers from SaaS vendors (Atlassian, Linear, Notion, etc.). Fastest setup, just register and go.
- **Composio MCP Servers** - Access 10,000+ pre-built servers through Composio's platform. Similar to Native, but with a wider selection.
- **Custom MCP Servers** - Build your own servers for custom APIs and business logic. Requires development and deployment.
