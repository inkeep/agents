MCP servers enable your agents to fetch real-time information and take action on your systems, services, and applications.

## Three ways to use MCP servers

### Native MCP Servers

The fastest way to get started is by connecting to Native MCP servers - these are pre-built servers provided directly by SaaS vendors that offer them. You don't need to build anything, just register them with your agents.

### Custom MCP Servers

When pre-built servers don't meet your needs, you can build custom MCP servers for your own APIs and business logic. After building and deploying your server, register it with your agents.
