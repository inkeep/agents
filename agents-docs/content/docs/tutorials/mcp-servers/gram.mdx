## Overview

Gram by Speakeasy turns any OpenAPI specification into a production-ready MCP server. Upload your API spec, and Gram automatically generates tool definitions, handles hosting and authentication, and deploys your server- so you can focus on building powerful agents.

Visit [Gram's documentation](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/gram/getting-started/openapi) for a complete guide.

### Step 1: [Create a Gram account](https://app.getgram.ai/login)

### Step 2: Upload your OpenAPI document

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In the Gram dashboard, click **Toolsets** in the sidebar (under **Create**)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Get Started**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Upload your OpenAPI document:
    - Select the OpenAPI document file from your computer
    - Enter a descriptive name for your API
    - Click **Upload**
  </Step>
</Steps>

Gram parses your OpenAPI document and extracts URL paths, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), request schemas (parameters and request bodies), and operation descriptions to help LLMs understand your API.

<Note>
Gram does not require a 100% valid OpenAPI document. As long as the key elements (paths, methods, request schemas, and descriptions) are present, Gram can successfully generate tool definitions.
</Note>

### Step 3: Ship 🚢

Your MCP server is ready to ship! Open the MCP page, and open your MCP server by clicking it. Click Enable to allow the MCP server to handle requests.

<Note>To add authentication, set the appropriate environment variables. See [Step 3 in the Gram documentation](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/gram/getting-started/openapi#step-3-set-environment-variables) for details.</Note>
