## Sub Agents, Tools

Inkeep is designed with Agents as the primary building blocks of AI systems.

In simple terms:
- A **Sub Agent** is an LLM (AI model) that receives a message and can use tools or collaborate with other Sub Agents to accomplish a goal.
- **Tools** are actions that a Sub Agent can take, like looking up information or taking an action on third-party systems and APIs.

In Inkeep, tools are added to Sub Agents as **MCP Servers**. Many services provide out-of-the-box MCP Servers, but you can also create your own. With Inkeep, you can register MCP servers and their associated **Credentials**, then use them within Agents as tools.

Typically, you want a Sub Agent to handle narrow, well-defined tasks. Keeping the scope narrow allows you to optimize your **prompt** (instructions) and the tools a Sub Agent has to be specific to a scenario or task. As a general rule of thumb, only add up to 5-7 tools to a Sub Agent.

## Agents

When what you're trying to accomplish gets complex, it can be useful to break up your logic into a "team" of Sub Agents that work together.

At Inkeep, we call that an **Agent**. An Agent is made up of one or more Sub Agents that collaborate to complete a task and respond to the user (hence "multi-agent" systems).

<Tip>
**You can treat an Agent as one Agent**: when you send a message, it'll sound and reply as one single Agent, even if internally it's coordinating across multiple Sub Agents. This is similar to how companies operate: there may be internal back-and-forths between employees, but a company acts as one cohesive unit to external audiences, like customers.
</Tip>

### Sub Agent to Sub Agent relationships

With Inkeep, every Agent has a **Default Sub Agent** that receives the initial message and decides how to proceed.

In an Agent, a Sub Agent can choose to:
- **Transfer** control of the chat to another Sub Agent so a different Sub Agent can respond to the user.
- **Delegate** a subtask for another Sub Agent to do and wait for its response before proceeding with the next step.

### Sub Agent 'turn'

In summary, when a Sub Agent receives a message, it can choose to:
1. Respond to the user
2. Call a tool to collect information or take an action
3. Transfer or delegate to another Sub Agent

The Agent keeps executing steps 2 and 3 until a Sub Agent in the Agent chooses to respond to the user with a final result or a next message.

## Authentication & API Keys

You can authenticate with your Agent using:

- **API Keys**: Securely hashed keys that are scoped to specific Agents
- **Development Mode**: No API key required, perfect for local development and testing
- **Bypass Secrets**: For internal services and infrastructure that need direct access

API keys are the recommended approach for production use, providing secure, scoped access to your Agents.

## Agent replies with Structured Data

Sometimes, you want your Agent to reply not in plain text, but with specific types of well-defined information often called 'Structured Outputs' (JSON).

With Inkeep, there are a few ways to do this:
- **Data Components**: Structured Outputs that Sub Agents can output in their messages so they can render rich, interactive UIs (lists, buttons, forms, etc.) or convey structured information.
- **Artifacts**: A Sub Agent can save information from a **tool call result** as an artifact in order to make it available to others. For example, a Sub Agent that did a web search can save the contents of a webpage it looked at as an artifact. Once saved, a Sub Agent can cite or reference artifacts in its response, and other Sub Agents or users can fetch the full artifacts if they'd like.
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress updates that can be plain text or Structured Outputs that can be used to keep users informed about what the Sub Agent is doing during longer operations.

## Passing context to Sub Agents

Beyond using Tools to fetch information, Sub Agents also receive information via:
- **Headers**: In the API request to an Agent, the calling application can include headers for a Sub Agent. Learn more [here](/typescript-sdk/headers).
- **Context Fetchers**: Can be configured for an Agent so that at the beginning of a conversation, an API call is automatically made to an external service to get information that is then made available to any Sub Agent. For example, your Headers may include a `user-id` which can be used to auto-fetch information from a CRM about the user for any Sub Agent to use.

Headers and fetched context can then be referenced explicitly as `{{variables}}` in Sub Agent prompts. Learn more [here](/typescript-sdk/headers).

The Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK work seamlessly together—define your Sub Agents in code, push them to the visual builder, and iterate visually.

## Projects

You can organize your related MCP Servers, Credentials, Agents, and more into **Projects**. A Project is generally used to represent a set of related scenarios.

For example, you may create one Project for your support team that has all the MCP servers and Agents related to customer support.

## CLI: Push and pull

The Inkeep CLI bridges your TypeScript SDK project and the Visual Builder.

Run the following from your project (the folder that contains your `inkeep.config.ts`) which has an `index.ts` file that exports a project.

- **Push (code → Builder)**: Sync locally defined agents, Sub Agents, tools, and settings from your SDK project into the Visual Builder.

```bash
inkeep push
```

- **Pull (Builder → code)**: Fetch your project from the Visual Builder back into your SDK project. By default, the CLI will LLM-assist in updating your local TypeScript files to reflect Builder changes.

```bash
inkeep pull
```

<Note>
Push and pull operate at the project level (not individual agents). Define agents in your project and push/pull the whole project.

See the [CLI Reference](/typescript-sdk/cli-reference) for full command details.
