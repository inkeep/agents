MCP tools connect to external servers that implement the MCP standard. This allows you to integrate with a wide ecosystem of existing tools and services.

<Snippet file="mcp/intro-create-and-add.mdx" />

### Registring an MCP Server

```typescript
import { agent, mcpTool } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const knowledgeBaseTool = mcpTool({
  id: "knowledge-base-tool",
  name: "knowledge_base",
  description: "Search the company knowledge base for information",
  serverUrl: "https://kb.yourcompany.com/mcp",
});

const qaAgent = agent({
  id: "qa-agent",
  name: "QA Agent",
  description: "Responsible for answering questions about the company knowledge base.",
  prompt: `You are a Question-Answer agent that can answer questions about the company knowledge base.
  You have access to the knowledge base tool to search for information.`,
  canUse: () => [knowledgeBaseTool],
});
```

<Note>Tip: When adding tools to an agent, you can also reference the tool in the agent's prompt to help the agent understand how to use the tool.</Note>

## Authentication

MCP servers support various authentication methods (via credentials):

- **No Authentication** - For public APIs or internal services
- **API Key** - For services requiring API keys
- **Bearer Token** - For JWT or similar token-based authentication
- **Token Authentication** - For custom token schemes
- **OAuth Flows** - For standard OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **OAuth 2.1 Flows** - For modern OAuth 2.1 "1-click" authentication

For OAuth flows and OAuth 2.1 flows, it's recommended to use the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/credentials) for easier configuration.

See [Credentials](/typescript-sdk/credentials) for detailed examples and implementation guidance for each authentication type.

### Custom Headers

You can configure custom headers for your MCP server requests. Use credentials for sensitive information (API keys, tokens) and headers for non-sensitive metadata (user agent, version info, etc.).

```typescript
import { mcpTool } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const customHeadersTool = mcpTool({
  id: "enterprise-api",
  name: "enterprise_data",
  description: "Enterprise API with custom headers",
  serverUrl: "https://enterprise.example.com/mcp",
  headers: {
    "User-Agent": "Inkeep-Agent/1.0",
    "X-Client-Version": "2024.1",
  },
});
```

## Selecting Tools

### Selective Tool Activation

Enable only specific tools from a server using MCP Server tool names in the `activeTools` field.

```typescript
import { mcpTool } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const selectiveTool = mcpTool({
  id: "limited-server",
  name: "analytics_readonly",
  description: "Analytics server with limited access",
  serverUrl: "https://analytics.example.com/mcp",
  activeTools: ["get_metrics", "generate_report"], // Only these tools
});
```

### Using agentMcp for Tool Selection

While `activeTools` in `mcpTool` limits which tools are available from the server, you can further refine tool access at the agent level using `agentMcp`. This allows different agents to use different subsets of tools from the same MCP server.

```typescript
import { agent, mcpTool, agentMcp } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

// Define the MCP server with all available tools
const echoTool = mcpTool({
  id: "echo-tool",
  name: "Echo tool",
  serverUrl: "https://mcp-for-next-js-seven-iota.vercel.app/mcp",
});

// Agent that only uses specific tools from the server
const weatherAssistant = agent({
  id: "weather-assistant",
  name: "Weather assistant",
  description: "Responsible for routing between the geocoder agent and weather forecast agent",
  prompt: "You are a helpful assistant. When the user asks about the weather in a given location, first ask the geocoder agent for the coordinates, and then pass those coordinates to the weather forecast agent to get the weather forecast",
  canDelegateTo: () => [weatherForecaster, geocoderAgent],
  canUse: () => [agentMcp({ server: echoTool, selectedTools: ["echo2"] })],
});
```
