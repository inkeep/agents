MCP servers enable your agents to fetch real-time information and take action on your systems, services, and applications. This guide covers multiple approaches to creating and deploying MCP servers for your agents.

## Out-of-the-box servers

The fastest way to get started is by connecting to existing MCP servers provided directly by SaaS providers that offer them.

### MCPs with OAuth 2.1/PKCE support

These servers often implement OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for secure authentication that allow for "1-click" authentication without the need to manually create API keys or credentials.

To add them to your Inkeep Project, use the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/tools/credentials).

## Build Your Own

Creating custom MCP servers gives you complete control over functionality and integration with your internal systems.

### Using Vercel Template

Vercel provides a [Next.js MCP template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/model-context-protocol-mcp-with-next-js) that makes it easy to deploy MCP servers with serverless functions.

Vercel's template provides:
- **Easy to deploy** staging environments
- **Serverless deployment** for automatic scaling with Vercel Functions
- **SSE transport** for real-time streaming (requires Redis for state management)
- **Next.js integration** so MCPs can be added as part of existing Next.js apps

#### Quick start
```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/mcp-for-next.js
cd mcp-for-next.js

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Configure your tools in app/[transport]/route.ts
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy
```

<Note>
Enable Fluid compute and set `maxDuration` to 800 in `app/route.ts` if you're on a Pro or Enterprise plan and have long-running operations.
</Note>

### Using Gram

[Speakeasy Gram](https://www.speakeasy.com/product/gram) provides a lightweight open source framework for repurposing and remixing existing APIs into MCP Servers.


### Using Anthropic's MCP SDKs

See [Anthropic's official MCP SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) for low-level building blocks for creating MCP servers in multiple languages like TypeScript, Python and Go.

#### TypeScript example

```typescript
import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';
import { z } from 'zod';

const server = new McpServer({
  name: 'custom-mcp-server',
  version: '1.0.0',
});

server.registerTool(
  'custom_tool',
  {
    title: 'Custom Tool',
    description: 'A custom tool for your specific needs',
    inputSchema: { input: z.string() },
  },
  async ({ input }) => ({
    content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Processed: ${input}` }],
  }),
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

## Use MCP Server Libraries

For rapid development, leverage existing MCP server libraries that provide pre-built integrations.

### Composio

[Composio](https://composio.dev/) offers a platform for building and managing MCP servers with access to 10,000+ pre-built tools and integrations.

#### Quick integration

Follow Composio's MCP Gateway setup to obtain your MCP server URL and credentials. Then register it as a tool in your project:

```typescript
import { mcpTool } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';

const composioTool = mcpTool({
  id: 'composio-tools',
  name: 'Composio Integration',
  description: 'Access popular SaaS tools via Composio',
  serverUrl: 'YOUR_COMPOSIO_MCP_URL', // From Composio dashboard
});
```
