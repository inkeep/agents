Sub Agent relationships are used to coordinate specialized Sub Agents for complex workflows. This framework implements Sub Agent relationships through using `canDelegateTo()` and `canTransferTo()`, allowing a parent Sub Agent to automatically coordinate specialized Sub Agents for complex workflows.

## Understanding Sub Agent Relationships

The framework supports two types of Sub Agent relationships:

### Transfer Relationships

Transfer relationships **completely relinquish control** from one Sub Agent to another. When a Sub Agent hands off to another:

- The source Sub Agent stops processing
- The target Sub Agent takes full control of the conversation
- Control is permanently transferred until the target Sub Agent hands back

```typescript
import { subAgent, agent } from "agent-sdk";

// Create specialized Sub Agents first
const qaSubAgent = subAgent({
  id: "qa-agent",
  name: "QA Sub Agent",
  description: "Answers product and service questions",
  prompt: "Provide accurate information using available tools. Hand back to router if unable to help.",
  canUse: () => [knowledgeBaseTool],
  canTransferTo: () => [routerSubAgent],
});

const orderSubAgent = subAgent({
  id: "order-agent",
  name: "Order Sub Agent",
  description: "Handles order-related inquiries and actions",
  prompt: "Assist with order tracking, modifications, and management.",
  canUse: () => [orderSystemTool],
  canTransferTo: () => [routerSubAgent],
});

// Create router Sub Agent that coordinates other Sub Agents
const routerSubAgent = subAgent({
  id: "router-agent",
  name: "Router Sub Agent",
  description: "Routes customer inquiries to specialized Sub Agents",
  prompt: `Analyze customer inquiries and route them appropriately:
    - Product questions → Hand off to QA Sub Agent
    - Order issues → Hand off to Order Sub Agent
    - Complex issues → Handle directly or escalate`,
  canTransferTo: () => [qaSubAgent, orderSubAgent],
});

// Create the agent with router as default entry point
const supportAgent = agent({
  id: "customer-support-agent",
  defaultSubAgent: routerSubAgent,
  subAgents: () => [routerSubAgent, qaSubAgent, orderSubAgent],
  modelSettings: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    structuredOutput: "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    providerOptions: {
      anthropic: { temperature: 0.5 },
    },
  },
});
```

### Delegation Relationships

Delegation relationships are used to **pass a task** from one Sub Agent to another while maintaining oversight:

- The source Sub Agent remains in control
- The target Sub Agent executes a specific task
- Results are returned to the source Sub Agent
- The source Sub Agent continues processing

```typescript
// Sub Agents for specific tasks
const numberProducerA = subAgent({
  id: "number-producer-a",
  name: "Number Producer A",
  description: "Produces low-range numbers (0-50)",
  prompt: "Generate numbers between 0 and 50. Respond with a single integer.",
});

const numberProducerB = subAgent({
  id: "number-producer-b",
  name: "Number Producer B",
  description: "Produces high-range numbers (50-100)",
  prompt: "Generate numbers between 50 and 100. Respond with a single integer.",
});

// Coordinating Sub Agent that delegates tasks
const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
  id: "math-supervisor",
  name: "Math Supervisor",
  description: "Coordinates mathematical operations",
  prompt: `When given a math task:
    1. Delegate to Number Producer A for a low number
    2. Delegate to Number Producer B for a high number
    3. Add the results together and provide the final answer`,
  canDelegateTo: () => [numberProducerA, numberProducerB],
});

const mathAgent = agent({
  id: "math-delegation-agent",
  defaultSubAgent: mathSupervisor,
  subAgents: () => [mathSupervisor, numberProducerA, numberProducerB],
  modelSettings: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    providerOptions: {
      anthropic: { temperature: 0.1 },
    },
  },
});
```

## When to Use Each Relationship

### Use Transfers for Complex Tasks

Use `canTransferTo` when the task is complex and the user will likely want to ask follow-up questions to the specialized Sub Agent:

- **Customer support conversations** - User may have multiple related questions
- **Technical troubleshooting** - Requires back-and-forth interaction
- **Order management** - User might want to modify, track, or ask about multiple aspects
- **Product consultations** - Users often have follow-up questions

### Use Delegation for Simple Tasks

Use `canDelegateTo` when the task is simple and self-contained:

- **Data retrieval** - Get a specific piece of information and return it
- **Calculations** - Perform a computation and return the result
- **Single API calls** - Make one external request and return the data
- **Simple transformations** - Convert data from one format to another

```typescript
// TRANSFER: User will likely have follow-up questions about their order
const routerSubAgent = subAgent({
  id: "router",
  prompt: "For order inquiries, transfer to order specialist",
  canTransferTo: () => [orderSubAgent],
});

// DELEGATION: Just need a quick calculation, then continue
const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
  id: "supervisor",
  prompt: "Delegate to number producers, then add results together",
  canDelegateTo: () => [numberProducerA, numberProducerB],
});
```

## Types of Delegation Relationships

### Sub Agent Delegation

Sub agent delegation is used to delegate a task to a sub agent as seen above.

### External Agent Delegation

External agent delegation is used to delegate a task to an [external agent](/typescript-sdk/external-agents).

```typescript
import { myExternalAgent } from "./external-agents/external-agent-example";
const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
  id: "supervisor",
  prompt: "Delegate to the external agent to calculate the answer to the question",
  canDelegateTo: () => [myExternalAgent],
});
```

You can also specify headers to include with every request to the external agent.

```typescript
const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
  id: "supervisor",
  prompt: "Delegate to the external agent to calculate the answer to the question",
  canDelegateTo: () => [myExternalAgent.with({ headers: { "authorization": "my-api-key" } })],
});
```

### Team Agent Delegation

Team agent delegation is used to delegate a task to another agent in the same project.

```typescript
import { myAgent } from "./agents/my-team-agent";

const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
  id: "supervisor",
  prompt: "Delegate to the team agent to calculate the answer to the question",
  canDelegateTo: () => [myAgent],
});
```

You can also specify headers to include with every request to the team agent.

```typescript
const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
  id: "supervisor",
  prompt: "Delegate to the team agent to calculate the answer to the question",
  canDelegateTo: () => [myAgent.with({ headers: { "authorization": "my-api-key" } })],
});
```
