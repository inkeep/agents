# Status Updates

The Inkeep Agent Framework provides intelligent, AI-powered status updates that automatically generate contextual progress messages during agent execution. These updates give users ChatGPT-style feedback about what's happening behind the scenes without exposing internal technical details.

## Overview

Status updates are automatically generated summaries that:

- **Track Progress**: Monitor agent operations, tool calls, and task completions
- **Provide Context**: Generate user-friendly descriptions of what's happening
- **Hide Complexity**: Abstract away internal agent names and technical operations
- **Stream Real-time**: Send updates via the same streaming interface as responses

<Callout type="info">
  Status updates use your graph's summarizer model to generate contextual,
  intelligent progress messages that feel natural to users.
</Callout>

## How It Works

The status updater operates through three main components:

### 1. GraphSession Event Tracking

Every agent operation is tracked as events:

- **agent_generate**: Text generation or structured output
- **transfer**: Agent-to-agent transfers
- **delegation_sent/returned**: Task delegation between agents
- **tool_execution**: Tool calls and results
- **artifact_saved**: Document or data artifacts created

### 2. Intelligent Triggering

Status updates are triggered by:

- **Event Count**: After N events (tool calls, generations, etc.)
- **Time Intervals**: Every N seconds of processing
- **Smart Detection**: Avoids updates during text streaming

### 3. AI-Powered Summarization

The summarizer model:

- Analyzes recent events and progress
- Generates user-friendly status messages
- Maintains context across multiple updates
- Focuses on user-visible outcomes

## Configuration

Configure status updates in your agent graph:

```typescript
export const graph = agentGraph({
  id: "my-graph",
  defaultAgent: myAgent,
  agents: () => [myAgent],

  // Model Settings with summarizer
  models: {
    base: { model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" },
    summarizer: { model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" }, // Model for status updates
  },

  // Status updates configuration
  statusUpdates: {
    numEvents: 3, // Trigger after 3 events
    timeInSeconds: 15, // Trigger every 15 seconds
    prompt: "Custom prompt for status updates", // Optional
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options

| Option             | Type   | Default       | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `numEvents`        | number | 10            | Trigger update after N events                                 |
| `timeInSeconds`    | number | 30            | Trigger update every N seconds                                |
| `model`            | string | graph default | Override model for summaries                                  |
| `prompt`           | string | undefined     | Custom prompt appended to base system prompt (max 2000 chars) |
| `statusComponents` | array  | undefined     | Structured status components (advanced)                       |

## Basic Example

```typescript
const searchAgent = agent({
  id: "search-agent",
  name: "Search Agent",
  prompt: "Help users search and analyze information.",
  canUse: () => [searchTool],
});

export const graph = agentGraph({
  id: "search-demo",
  defaultAgent: searchAgent,
  agents: () => [searchAgent],

  models: {
    base: { model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" },
    summarizer: { model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" },
  },

  // Enable status updates
  statusUpdates: {
    numEvents: 2, // Update every 2 operations
    timeInSeconds: 10, // Or every 10 seconds
  },
});
```

**User Experience:**
When a user asks "What's the weather in Paris?", they might see:

1. "Searching for current weather information..."
2. "Found weather data, analyzing conditions..."
3. "Preparing detailed weather report..."

## Custom Prompts

You can customize how status updates are generated by providing a custom prompt that gets appended to the base system prompt. Custom prompts are limited to 2000 characters to ensure optimal performance:

```typescript
export const graph = agentGraph({
  id: "my-graph",
  defaultAgent: myAgent,
  agents: () => [myAgent],
  models: {
    summarizer: { model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" },
  },
  statusUpdates: {
    numEvents: 3,
    timeInSeconds: 15,
    // Custom prompt is appended to the base system prompt
    prompt: "KEEP ALL STATUS UPDATES SHORT AND CONCISE. Use bullet points and focus only on user-visible progress.",
  },
});
```

### Custom Prompt Examples

**Concise Updates:**

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  prompt: 'Keep responses to 5 words maximum. Use present tense verbs.',
}
// Results in: "Searching documentation", "Processing data", "Generating report"
```

**Detailed Progress:**

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  prompt: 'Provide specific details about what was found or accomplished. Include relevant numbers or names when available.',
}
// Results in: "Found 12 API endpoints in authentication docs", "Retrieved user profile for john@example.com"
```

**Branded Tone:**

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  prompt: 'Use a friendly, helpful tone. Start updates with action words like "Discovering", "Exploring", "Analyzing".',
}
// Results in: "Discovering relevant documentation...", "Analyzing search results for best matches"
```

## Advanced: Structured Status Updates

For more control over status format, use structured status components:

<Callout type="info">
  **Schema Update**: The status components schema has been simplified. Use
  `type` instead of `id` and `name`, and `detailsSchema` instead of `schema`.
  The `detailsSchema` is now optional.
</Callout>

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  numEvents: 3,
  timeInSeconds: 15,
  // Custom prompt also works with structured components
  prompt: 'Focus on actionable insights. Be specific about what was found.',
  statusComponents: [
    {
      type: 'tool_summary',
      description: 'Summary of tool calls and their purpose',
      detailsSchema: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          tool_name: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'Name of tool used'
          },
          purpose: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'Why this tool was called'
          },
          outcome: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'What was discovered or accomplished'
          },
        },
        required: ['tool_name', 'purpose', 'outcome'],
      },
    },
    {
      type: 'progress_update',
      description: 'Current progress and next steps',
      detailsSchema: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          current_task: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'What is currently being worked on'
          },
          completion_percentage: {
            type: 'number',
            description: 'Estimated completion percentage (0-100)'
          },
          next_steps: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'What will happen next'
          },
        },
        required: ['current_task'],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Frontend Integration

Status updates arrive as `data-summary` events with AI-generated labels and contextual details:

```typescript
// In your message processing
message.parts.forEach((part) => {
  if (part.type === "data-summary") {
    const { label, details } = part.data;

    // Display the user-friendly status label
    displayStatusUpdate(label);

    // Handle optional structured details
    if (details) {
      // Unstructured summary text
      if (details.summary) {
        displayDetailedSummary(details.summary);
      }
      
      // Any structured data (progress, counts, etc.)
      displayStructuredDetails(details);
    }
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

### Timing Configuration

- **Quick Operations**: Use higher event counts (5-10) to avoid too many updates
- **Long Operations**: Use shorter time intervals (10-15 seconds) for responsiveness
- **Mixed Workloads**: Combine both triggers for balanced updates

### Model Selection

- **Same Model**: Use the same model for agents and status updates for consistency
- **Faster Model**: Use a faster/cheaper model for status updates to reduce latency
- **Specialized Model**: Use a model optimized for summarization tasks

### User Experience

```typescript
// Good: Descriptive and actionable
"Searching through documentation to find API authentication methods...";
"Found OAuth2 setup prompt, now checking for code examples...";

// Avoid: Too technical or vague
"Agent thinking...";
"Processing data-operation with tool_invocation type...";
```

## Troubleshooting

### Updates Not Appearing

Check that:

1. Status updates are configured in your graph
2. The summarizer model is specified
3. Events are being triggered (tool calls, generations)
4. The session hasn't ended prematurely

### Too Many/Few Updates

Adjust thresholds:

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  numEvents: 5,        // Increase for fewer updates
  timeInSeconds: 20,   // Increase for less frequent updates
}
```

### Poor Update Quality

Improve with custom prompts:

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  numEvents: 3,
  timeInSeconds: 15,
  prompt: `Generate a brief, user-friendly status update that explains what has been accomplished and what is currently happening. Focus on user-visible progress, not internal operations. Be specific about findings, not just actions.`
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Status updates are automatically paused during text streaming to avoid
  interrupting the response flow.
</Callout>

## Performance Considerations

- Status updates use additional model calls - consider costs for high-volume applications
- Updates are generated asynchronously and won't block main agent operations
- The system automatically prevents duplicate updates during concurrent operations
