Securely store and retrieve authentication credentials for MCP servers.

## Step 1: Add a credential

<Snippet file="multi-agent-framework/add-a-credential.mdx" />

## Step 2: Retrieve the credential reference id from the URLs

Once you've created a credential, you can retrieve the credential reference id from the URL. The credential reference id is the last part of the URL after `credentials/` on the page of the credential you just created.

## Step 3: Reference the credential when creating an MCP tool

Now that you have a credential reference id, you can reference it when creating an MCP tool that requires authentication.

```typescript
import { mcpTool } from "agent-sdk";
import { credential } from "agent-sdk";
import { CredentialStoreType } from "agent-sdk";

const inkeepApiKeyCredential = credential({
  id: "inkeep-api-key",
  type: CredentialStoreType.memory,
  credentialStoreId: "memory-default",
  retrievalParams: {
    key: "INKEEP_API_KEY",
  },
});

const inkeepAnalyticsTool = mcpTool({
  id: "inkeep-analytics",
  tenantId: "your-tenant",
  name: "inkeep_analytics",
  description: "Get the latest stats from the Inkeep Analytics dashboard",
  serverUrl: "https://analytics.inkeep.com/mcp",
  credentialReference: inkeepApiKeyCredential, // Reference to stored credentials
  transport: {
    type: MCPTransportType.streamableHttp,
  },
});
```
