## Overview

Conversation memory determines how much of the conversation history is included in the context window when your Agent processes a new message. The Inkeep Agent Framework automatically manages conversation history to balance context retention with token efficiency.

## Default Limits

By default, the system includes conversation history using these limits:

- **50 messages**: Up to the 50 most recent messages from the conversation
- **4,000 tokens**: Maximum of 4,000 tokens from previous conversation messages

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Message Retrieval**: The system retrieves up to 50 most recent messages from the conversation history
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Token Calculation**: Messages are processed, calculating token count for each message
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Exclusion**: If the total token count exceeds 4,000 tokens, older messages are excluded from the context window
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The 50-message and 4,000-token limits are fixed and cannot be configured at this time.
