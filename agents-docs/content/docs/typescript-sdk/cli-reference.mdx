## Overview

The Inkeep CLI is the primary tool for interacting with the Inkeep Agent Framework. It allows you to push Agent configurations and interact with your multi-agent system.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the CLI globally
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli

# Install the dashboard package (for visual agents orchestration)
npm install @inkeep/agents-manage-ui
```

## Global Options

All commands support the following global options:

- `--version` - Display CLI version
- `--help` - Display help for a command

## Commands

<CLIReference />

## Configuration File

The CLI uses a configuration file (typically `inkeep.config.ts`) to store settings:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@inkeep/agents-cli/config";

export default defineConfig({
  tenantId: "your-tenant-id",
  agentsManageApi: {
    url: "http://localhost:3002",
  },
  agentsRunApi: {
    url: "http://localhost:3003",
  },
});
```

### Configuration Priority

Effective resolution order:

1. Command-line flags (highest)
2. Environment variables (override config values)
3. `inkeep.config.ts` values

## Environment Variables

The CLI and SDK respect the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `INKEEP_TENANT_ID` | Tenant identifier |
| `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_URL` | Management API base URL |
| `INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_URL` | Run API base URL |
| `INKEEP_ENV` | Environment name for credentials loading during `inkeep push` |
| `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_BYPASS_SECRET` | Optional bearer for Manage API (advanced) |
| `INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_BYPASS_SECRET` | Optional bearer for Run API (advanced) |

## Troubleshooting

### Project Not Found

- Projects are automatically managed based on your tenantId
- `inkeep push` will create resources as needed

### Getting Help

For additional help with any command:

```bash
inkeep [command] --help
```
