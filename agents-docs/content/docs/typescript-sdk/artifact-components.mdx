Artifact components let agents save information from tool calls so it can be referenced later by the same agent or other agents in the graph.

## What Are Artifacts?

When an agent uses a tool (like web search), the tool returns information. Instead of losing this information after the response, artifacts save it for future use.

**Think of artifacts like bookmarks with content** - they store both a summary (for quick reference) and the full details (for deep analysis).

## Why Use Artifacts?

- **Share data between agents**: Research agent finds sources, writing agent uses them for citations
- **Reference tool results**: Keep search results, API responses, or file contents for later use  
- **Maintain sources**: Track where information came from for transparency

## Basic Example

Here's a simple artifact component for saving web search results:

```typescript
const searchAgent = agent({
  id: "search-agent",
  name: "Search Agent",
  prompt: "Search the web and save useful sources as artifacts",
  
  canUse: () => [webSearchTool],
  
  artifactComponents: [
    {
      id: "web-source",
      name: "Web Source",
      description: "Information found from web searches",
      
      // Summary: Quick info shown to agents
      summaryProps: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          title: { type: "string", description: "Page title" },
          url: { type: "string", description: "Page URL" },
        },
        required: ["title", "url"],
      },
      
      // Full content: Complete details stored in database
      fullProps: {
        type: "object", 
        properties: {
          content: { type: "string", description: "Full page content" },
          author: { type: "string", description: "Author name" },
          date: { type: "string", description: "Publication date" },
        },
        required: ["content"],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## How Artifacts Work

### 1. Tool Returns Data
When `webSearchTool` finds a webpage, it returns structured data matching your artifact schema.

### 2. Artifact Gets Created
The framework automatically creates an artifact with:
- **Summary**: Title and URL (quick reference)
- **Full details**: Complete content, author, date (stored for later)

### 3. Agent References Artifact
The agent can mention the artifact in its response: "I found this information about AI trends [artifact-123]"

### 4. Other Agents Access Artifacts
Other agents in the same graph can see and use these artifacts in their own responses.

## Complete Example: Research and Writing

Here's how two agents can work together using artifacts:

```typescript
// Agent 1: Finds information and creates artifacts
const researchAgent = agent({
  id: "researcher", 
  name: "Research Agent",
  prompt: "Search for information and save sources as artifacts",
  
  canUse: () => [webSearchTool],
  
  artifactComponents: [
    {
      id: "source",
      name: "Source",
      description: "Research source with citation info",
      summaryProps: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          title: { type: "string" },
          url: { type: "string" },
          relevance: { type: "string", enum: ["high", "medium", "low"] },
        },
        required: ["title", "url", "relevance"],
      },
      fullProps: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          content: { type: "string", description: "Full article text" },
          key_points: { 
            type: "array", 
            items: { type: "string" },
            description: "Main points from the article"
          },
        },
        required: ["content"],
      },
    },
  ],
});

// Agent 2: Uses artifacts from research agent to write reports  
const writerAgent = agent({
  id: "writer",
  name: "Writing Agent", 
  prompt: "Write reports using sources found by the research agent. Include citations.",
  
  // Same artifact component - can access artifacts created by research agent
  artifactComponents: [
    {
      id: "source", // Same ID as research agent
      name: "Source",
      description: "Research source with citation info",
      // ... same schema as above
    },
  ],
});

// Graph connecting the agents
export const researchGraph = agentGraph({
  id: "research-graph",
  agents: () => [researchAgent, writerAgent],
  defaultAgent: researchAgent,
});

// Allow research agent to delegate to writer
researchAgent.config.canDelegateTo = () => [writerAgent];
```

## Usage Flow

1. **User**: "Write a report about renewable energy trends"

2. **Research Agent**: 
   - Uses `webSearchTool` to find articles
   - Creates artifacts for each source found
   - Delegates to writing agent: "I found 3 good sources about renewable energy. Please write a report."

3. **Writing Agent**:
   - Sees artifacts created by research agent in its context
   - Writes report referencing the artifacts: "According to recent research [source-1], solar adoption has increased..."

4. **User gets**: A complete report with proper citations, where each citation links to the full source content.

## Key Points

- **Shared**: Artifacts are shared across all agents in the same graph
- **Automatic**: Created automatically when tools return matching data
- **Structured**: Use JSON schema to define what data to capture
- **Traceable**: Every piece of information can be traced back to its source
