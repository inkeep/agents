External agents let you integrate agents built outside of Inkeep—using other frameworks or platforms—into your Agent. They communicate over the A2A (Agent‑to‑Agent) protocol so your Inkeep sub-agents can delegate tasks to them as if they were native. Note that Inkeep Agents are available via an [A2A endpoint](/talk-to-your-agents/a2a) themselves and used from other platforms.

Learn more about A2A:
- A2A overview on the Google Developers Blog: [A2A — a new era of agent interoperability](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)
- A2A protocol site: [a2a.how](https://a2a.how/)

Examples platforms that expose Agents in A2A-format:

| [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/) | Native | Official guide to build agents that expose/consume A2A. |
| [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/semantic-kernel-a2a-integration/) | Native | “SK now speaks A2A” with sample to expose compliant agents. |
| [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/a2a/) | Native | Convenience method to publish a Pydantic AI agent as an A2A server. |
| [AWS Strands Agents SDK](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/multi-agent/agent-to-agent/) | Native | A2A support in Strands for cross‑platform agent communication. |
| [CrewAI](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/intro-a2a-purchasing-concierge) | With Adapter | Use the A2A Python SDK to serve a CrewAI agent over A2A. |
| [LlamaIndex](https://a2aprotocol.ai/blog/a2a-samples-llama-index-file-chat-openrouter) | With Adapter | Example Workflows app exposed via A2A (agent + card). |

<Note>
  Any agent that exposes an A2A‑compatible HTTP endpoint can be integrated by providing its `baseUrl` plus headers/auth (static or dynamic).

## Creating an External Agent

Every external agent needs a unique identifier, name, description, base URL for A2A communication, and optional authentication configuration:

```typescript
import { externalAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const technicalSupportAgent = externalAgent({
  id: "technical-support-agent",
  name: "Technical Support Team",
  description: "External technical support specialists for complex issues",
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/agents/technical-support", // A2A endpoint
});
```

## External Agent Relationships

Agents can be configured to delegate tasks to external agents.

```typescript
import { subAgent, agent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

// Define the customer support sub-agent with delegation capabilities
const supportSubAgent = subAgent({
  id: "support-agent",
  name: "Customer Support Sub-Agent",
  description: "Handles customer inquiries and escalates technical issues",
  prompt: `You are a customer support sub-agent that handles general customer inquiries.`,
  canDelegateTo: () => [technicalSupportAgent],
});

// Create the customer support agent with external agent capabilities
export const supportAgent = agent({
  id: "customer-support-agent",
  name: "Customer Support System",
  description: "Handles customer inquiries and escalates to technical teams when needed",
  defaultSubAgent: supportSubAgent,
  subAgents: () => [supportSubAgent, technicalSupportAgent],
});
```

## External Agent Options

Configure authentication and custom headers as needed (static values or dynamic context variables).

```typescript
const supportExternal = externalAgent({
  // Required
  name: "External Support Agent", // Human-readable agent name
  description: "External AI agent for specialized support", // Agent's purpose
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/agents/support", // A2A endpoint URL

  // Optional - Static or dynamic headers
  headers: {
    Authorization: "{{headers.Authorization}}",
  },

  // Optional - Credential Reference
  credentialReference: myCredentialReference,
});
```
