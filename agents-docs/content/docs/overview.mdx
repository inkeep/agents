With Inkeep, you can create and manage Agents with the **No-Code Visual Builder** or **TypeScript Agents SDK**.

Inkeep Agents are often used as:

- A **Customer-facing Agent** that you embed as a support assistant in your help center, copilot in your app, or sales chatbot on your marketing site.
- An **Internal Agent** accessible from Claude, ChatGPT, Slack, Zendesk, Cursor, and other apps your team uses
- A **Workflow Agent** used to automate repetitive tasks at scale, like updating docs, creating blog posts, summarizing sales calls, and more.

Agents are flexible and customizable - they can take on the role you need them to. All powered by the same knowledge of your product and company.

To get started, you can try the **open-source** edition (this docs site) or to learn about Inkeep Cloud, see [here](/oss-enterprise-comparison).

## Two ways to build your agents

1. **Agent Visual Builder**: A no-code interface designed to let both technical and non-technical teams create and manage agents.

2. **TypeScript Agents SDK**: A code-first approach for building and managing agents and multi-agent systems, allowing you to build complex agent systems with the tools your engineering team expects.

   ```typescript
   import { agent, agentGraph } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = agent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "A basic agent",
     prompt:
       'You are a basic agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const graph = agentGraph({
     id: "basic-graph",
     name: "Basic Graph Example",
     description: "A basic graph",
     defaultAgent: helloAgent,
     agents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and Agents SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.

## Key Concepts

- **Agents**: LLM and AI driven decision-making units defined by instructions ('prompts') that can take actions, answer questions, and coordinate with other agents as needed.
- **Graphs**: A team of agents that work together to perform complex tasks across your apps and APIs.
- **Tools**: The capabilities that agents can invoke. Tools can be your own custom functions or you can leverage our pre-built MCP tools for common integrations.
- **Transfers and Delegations**: Relationships between agents. Transfers involve a transfer of control of the chat from one agent to another, and delegation allows an agent to create a sub-task for a different agent.
- **Traces**: A log that gives you full visibility into every step of how an agent graph ran. Accessible via UI or OpenTelemetry.

## Advanced Features

- **Data Components**: Define what agents can output in their messages so they can render rich, interactive UIs (lists, buttons, forms, etc.).
- **Context Fetchers**: A way to retrieve and cache data about your user or apps so that an agent has it immediately available in its prompt.
- **Artifacts**: A piece of data that can be saved by an agent so it is accessible to other agents or users.
