With Inkeep, you can build and ship AI Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** or **TypeScript SDK**. Agents can be edited in either code or no-code with **full 2-way sync**, so your technical and non-technical teams can create and manage Agents in a single platform.

## Use Cases

<<<<<<< HEAD
Inkeep Agents can operate as real-time **AI Chat Assistants**, for example:

- a customer experience agent for customer support, technical docs, or in-app product copilot
- an internal copilot to assist your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams

Agents can also be used to automate complex **AI Workflows** for tasks like:
- Creating and updating knowledge bases, docs, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, triaging tickets, and completing other business processes

## Two ways to build

### No-Code Visual Agent Builder

   ```typescript
   import { agent, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = subAgent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "Says hello",
     prompt: 'Only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const basicAgent = agent({
     id: "basic-agent",
     name: "Basic Agent Example",
     description: "A basic agent that just says hello",
     defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
     subAgents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
