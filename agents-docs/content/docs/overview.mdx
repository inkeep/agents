---

With Inkeep, you can build and ship AI Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** or **TypeScript SDK**. Agents can be edited in code or no-code with **full 2-way sync**, so technical and non-technical teams can create and manage the same Agents in one platform.

## Agentic Chat Assistants
Inkeep Agents can operate as conversational assistants, for example:
- a customer experience agent for customer support, technical docs, or in-app copilot
- an internal copilot to assist your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams

## Agentic Workflows
Agents can also be used for workflow automation like:
- Creating and updating knowledge bases, documentation, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, triaging helpdesk tickets, and streamlining repetitive tasks

## Two ways to build

### No-Code Visual Builder

A no-code drag-and-drop canvas designed to allow any team to create and manage teams of Agents visually.

### TypeScript Agents SDK

A code-first approach for building and managing teams of Agents. The SDK allows engineering teams to build with the tools and developer experience they expect.

   ```typescript
   import { agent, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = subAgent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "Says hello",
     prompt: 'Only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const basicAgent = agent({
     id: "basic-agent",
     name: "Basic Agent Example",
     description: "A basic agent",
     defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
     subAgents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
