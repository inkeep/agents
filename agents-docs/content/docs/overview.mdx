Inkeep is a platform to create and manage AI Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** or **TypeScript SDK**. With **full 2-way sync**, technical and non-technical teams can create Agents in one platform. 

Inkeep Agents connect to your knowledge sources to answer questions and use tools to perform tasks across your apps and APIs.

## Use Cases

With Inkeep you can build **real-time chat assistants** like:
- a **customer experience agent** for support, docs, or in-app experiences
- an **internal copilot** to do work for your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams

Agents can also be used for **agentic workflows** like:
- Creating and updating knowledge bases, docs, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, filling out RFPs, etc.
- Automating back-office tasks for operations teams

## Inkeep Open Source

Inkeep **Open Source** (this docs site) includes:
- A Visual Builder & TypeScript SDK with 2-way sync
- Multi-Agent Architecture to support Teams of Agents
- MCP Tools with Credential Management
- A UI Component Library for dynamic AI chat experiences
- Triggering Agents with MCP, A2A, & Vercel SDK APIs
- Observability via Traces UI & OpenTelemetry

## Two ways to build Agents

### No-Code Visual Builder

A no-code interface designed to let both technical and non-technical teams create and manage agents.

### TypeScript SDK

A code-first approach for building and managing agents, allowing you to build complex multi-agent systems and workflows with the tools your engineering team expects.

   ```typescript
   import { agent, agentGraph } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = agent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "A basic agent",
     prompt: 'You are a basic agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const graph = agentGraph({
     id: "basic-graph",
     name: "Basic Graph Example",
     description: "A basic graph",
     defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
     agents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
