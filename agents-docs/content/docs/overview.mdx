With Inkeep, you can create and manage Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** or a **TypeScript Developer SDK**. With the **2-way sync**, both technical and non-technical teams can create and edit Agents collaboratively in either format.

Inkeep Agents can get work done as:
- A **Customer-facing Agent** that you embed as an support assistant in your help center, copilot in your app, or chatbot on your marketing site.
- An **Internal Agent** accessible from Slack, Zendesk, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other apps your team uses.
- A **Workflow Agent** used to automate repetitive tasks at scale, like updating docs, creating blog posts, summarizing sales calls, and more.

Agents are flexible and customizable - they can take on the role you need them to. All powered by the same knowledge of your product and company, and with access to tools that integrate with your systems so they can take action.

To get started, you can try the **open-source** edition (this docs site), or to learn about Inkeep Cloud and Managed Agents for Customer Experience, see [here](https://inkeep.com/get-started).

## Two ways to build your agents

1. **Agent Visual Builder**: A no-code interface designed to let both technical and non-technical teams create and manage agents.

2. **TypeScript Agents SDK**: A code-first approach for building and managing agents and multi-agent systems, allowing you to build complex agent systems with the tools your engineering team expects.

   ```typescript
   import { agent, agentGraph } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = agent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "A basic agent",
     prompt:
       'You are a basic agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const graph = agentGraph({
     id: "basic-graph",
     name: "Basic Graph Example",
     description: "A basic graph",
     defaultAgent: helloAgent,
     agents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and Agents SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
