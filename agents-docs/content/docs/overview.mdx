With Inkeep, you can create and manage Agents with the **No-Code Visual Builder** or **TypeScript Agents SDK**.

Inkeep Agents are often used as:

- A **Customer-facing Agent** that you embed as a support assistant in your help center, copilot in your app, or sales chatbot on your marketing site.
- An **Internal Agent** accessible from Claude, ChatGPT, Slack, Zendesk, Cursor, and other apps your team uses
- A **Workflow Agent** used to automate repetitive tasks at scale, like updating docs, creating blog posts, summarizing sales calls, and more.

Agents are flexible and customizable - they can take on the role you need them to. All powered by the same knowledge of your product and company.

To get started, you can try the **open-source** edition (this docs site) or to learn about Inkeep Cloud, see [here](/oss-enterprise-comparison).

## Two ways to build your agents

1. **Agent Visual Builder**: A no-code interface designed to let both technical and non-technical teams create and manage agents.

2. **TypeScript Agents SDK**: A code-first approach for building and managing agents and multi-agent systems, allowing you to build complex agent systems with the tools your engineering team expects.

   ```typescript
   import { agent, agentGraph } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = agent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "A basic agent",
     prompt:
       'You are a basic agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const graph = agentGraph({
     id: "basic-graph",
     name: "Basic Graph Example",
     description: "A basic graph",
     defaultAgent: helloAgent,
     agents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and Agents SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
