With Inkeep, you can create and manage Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** or a **TypeScript Developer SDK**. With **full 2-way sync**, both technical and non-technical teams can create and edit Agents collaboratively in either format.

Inkeep Agents are often rolled out as:
- A **Customer-facing Agent** that you embed as a support assistant in your help center, copilot in your app, or chatbot on your marketing site.
- An **Internal Agent** accessible from Slack, Zendesk, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other apps your teams uses.
- A **Workflow Agent** used to automate repetitive tasks at scale, like updating docs, creating blog posts, summarizing sales calls, and more.

Agents are flexible and customizable - they can take on the role you need them with access to tools that integrate with your systems so they can take action.

## Inkeep Open Source

Inkeep **Open Source** (this docs site) includes:
- A Visual Builder & TypeScript SDK with 2-way sync
- Team-Based Agent Architecture (Multiple Sub Agents working together)
- MCP Tools with Credential Management
- A Chat UI Component Library
- Chat with Agents in MCP, A2A, or Vercel SDK formats
- Observability via Traces UI & OpenTelemetry

## Two ways to build Agents

### No-Code Visual Builder

A no-code interface designed to let both technical and non-technical teams create and manage agents.

### TypeScript Agents SDK

A code-first approach for building and managing agents, including complex agents with multiple sub agents working together. Build with the tools your engineering team expects.

   ```typescript
   import { subAgent, agent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = subAgent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "A basic sub agent",
     prompt: 'You are a basic sub agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const myAgent = agent({
     id: "basic-agent",
     name: "Basic Agent Example",
     description: "A basic agent",
     defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
     subAgents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and Agents SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
