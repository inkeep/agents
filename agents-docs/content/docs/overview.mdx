With Inkeep, you can build AI Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** and **Developer SDK**. Agents can be edited in either with **full 2-way sync**, so technical and non-technical teams can create and manage their Agents in one platform.

## Two ways to build

### No-Code Visual Builder

A drag-and-drop canvas so any team can create and own the Agents they care about.

### TypeScript Agents SDK

A code-first framework so engineering teams can build with the tools they expect.

```typescript
import { agent, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
import { consoleMcp } from "./mcp";

const helloAgent = subAgent({
  id: "hello-agent",
  name: "Hello Agent",
  description: "Says hello",
  canUse: () => [consoleMcp], 
  prompt: `Reply to the user and console log "hello world" with fun variations like h3llo world`,
});

export const basicAgent = agent({
  id: "basic-agent",
  name: "Basic Agent",
  description: "A basic agent",
  defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
  subAgents: () => [helloAgent],
});
```

The **Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.

## Use cases

Inkeep Agents can operate as **Agentic AI Chat Assistants**, for example:

- a customer experience agent for help centers, technical docs, or in-app experiences
- an internal copilot to assist your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams

Agents can also be used for **Agentic Workflow Automation** like:

- Creating and updating knowledge bases, documentation, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, triaging helpdesk tickets, and tackling repetitive tasks

## Platform Overview

**Inkeep Open Source** includes:

- A Visual Builder & TypeScript SDK with 2-way sync
- Multi-agent architecture to support teams of agents
- MCP Tools with credentials management
- A UI component library for dynamic chat experiences
- Triggering Agents via MCP, A2A, & Vercel SDK APIs
