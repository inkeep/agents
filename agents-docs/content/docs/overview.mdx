With Inkeep, you can build AI Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** and **TypeScript SDK**. Agents can be edited in either with **full 2-way sync**, so technical and non-technical teams can create and manage their Agents in one platform.

## Two ways to build

### No-Code Visual Builder

A no-code canvas so any team can create and own the Agents they care about.

### TypeScript Agents SDK

A code-first framework so engineering teams can build with the tools they expect.

   ```typescript
import { agent, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
import { lookupOrderTool } from "../tools/lookup-order";
import { processRefundTool } from "../tools/process-refund";

const orderInquiryAgent = subAgent({
    id: "order-inquiry",
    name: "Order Inquiry Agent",
    description: "Handles questions about order status, shipping, and tracking",
    prompt: "You are a helpful customer service agent specializing in order inquiries. Help customers track their orders, provide shipping updates, and answer questions about delivery times. Always be professional and empathetic.",
    canUse: () => [lookupOrderTool],
});

const returnsAgent = subAgent({
    id: "returns-refunds",
    name: "Returns & Refunds Agent",
    description: "Processes return requests and handles refund inquiries",
    prompt: "You handle returns and refunds. Guide customers through the return process, explain refund policies, and help resolve any issues with returns. Be understanding and solution-oriented.",
    canUse: () => [processRefundTool],
});

export const customerSupportAgent = agent({
    id: "customer-support",
    name: "Customer Support Agent",
    description: "Main customer support agent that routes to specialized agents",
    defaultSubAgent: orderInquiryAgent,
    subAgents: () => [orderInquiryAgent, returnsAgent],
});
   ```

The **Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.

## Use cases
Inkeep Agents can operate as **Agentic Chat Assistants**, for example:
- a customer experience agent for help centers, technical docs, or in-app experiences
- an internal copilot to assist your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams

Agents can also be used for **Agentic Workflow Automation** like:
- Creating and updating knowledge bases, documentation, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, triaging helpdesk tickets, and tackling repetitive tasks

## Platform Overview

**Inkeep Open Source** includes:
- A Visual Builder & TypeScript SDK with 2-way sync
- Multi-agent architecture to support teams of agents
- MCP Tools with credentials management
- A UI component library for dynamic chat experiences
- Triggering Agents via MCP, A2A, & Vercel SDK APIs
