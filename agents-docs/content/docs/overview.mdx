Inkeep is an open platform for creating AI Agents with a **No-Code Visual Builder** and **TypeScript SDK**. With **full 2-way sync**, technical and non-technical teams can create and manage Agents in one platform.

## Use Cases

With Inkeep you can build agent-driven **Chat Assistants** like:
- a customer experience agent for support, docs, or in-app copilots
- an internal copilot to do work for your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams

Agents can also be used to automate complex **AI Workflows** like:
- Creating and updating knowledge bases, docs, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, triaging tickets, and other business operations and processes

## Two ways to build Agents

### No-Code Visual Builder

A no-code interface designed to let both technical and non-technical teams create and manage Agents.

### TypeScript SDK

A code-first approach for building and managing teams of Agents. Build with the tools your engineering team expects.

   ```typescript
   import { agent, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

   const helloAgent = subAgent({
     id: "hello-agent",
     name: "Hello Agent",
     description: "Says hello",
     prompt: 'You are a basic Agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
   });

   export const basicAgent = agent({
     id: "basic-agent",
     name: "Basic Agent Example",
     description: "A basic agent",
     defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
     subAgents: () => [helloAgent],
   });
   ```

The **Visual Builder and Agents TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable**: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Sub Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.
