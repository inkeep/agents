The InkeepEmbeddedChat component provides a fully embedded chat interface that you can integrate directly into your React application's layout. Unlike modal or sidebar implementations, the embedded chat becomes part of your page structure, perfect for dedicated support pages, dashboards, or help centers.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="npm"
npm install @inkeep/agents-ui
```

```bash title="yarn"
yarn add @inkeep/agents-ui
```

```bash title="pnpm"
pnpm add @inkeep/agents-ui
```

</CodeGroup>

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production">
    
    Use an API key for secure authentication in production:
    
    ```tsx
    import { InkeepEmbeddedChat, type InkeepEmbeddedChatProps } from "@inkeep/agents-ui";

    export default function App() {
      const embeddedChatProps: InkeepEmbeddedChatProps = {
        aiChatSettings: {
          agentUrl: "https://your-api.example.com/api/chat",
          apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_INKEEP_API_KEY, // Your API key
        },
      };

      return <InkeepEmbeddedChat {...embeddedChatProps} />;
    }
    ```

    **To get an API key:**
    1. Open the Visual Builder Dashboard
    2. Navigate to your Project â†’ **API Keys**
    3. Click **Create New Key** and select your agent
    4. Copy the key (shown once) and store it in your environment variables

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Development">
    
    For local development, use headers with your agent IDs:

    ```tsx
    import {
      InkeepEmbeddedChat,
      type InkeepEmbeddedChatProps,
    } from "@inkeep/agents-ui";

    export default function App() {
      const embeddedChatProps: InkeepEmbeddedChatProps = {
        aiChatSettings: {
          agentUrl: "http://localhost:3003/api/chat",
          headers: {
            "x-inkeep-tenant-id": "your-tenant-id",
            "x-inkeep-project-id": "your-project-id",
            "x-inkeep-agent-id": "your-agent-id",
          },
        },
      };

      return <InkeepEmbeddedChat {...embeddedChatProps} />;
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Run your API server with `ENVIRONMENT=development` to bypass authentication.
