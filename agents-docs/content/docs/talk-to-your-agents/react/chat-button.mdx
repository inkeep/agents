```

</CodeGroup>

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production">
    
    Use an API key for secure authentication in production:
    
    ```tsx
    import { InkeepChatButton, type InkeepChatButtonProps } from "@inkeep/agents-ui";

    const buttonProps: InkeepChatButtonProps = {
      aiChatSettings: {
        graphUrl: "https://your-api.example.com/api/chat",
        apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_INKEEP_API_KEY, // Your API key
      },
    };

    const ChatButton = () => {
      return <InkeepChatButton {...buttonProps} />;
    };
    ```

    **To get an API key:**
    1. Open the Visual Builder Dashboard
    2. Navigate to your Project â†’ **API Keys**
    3. Click **Create New Key** and select your agent
    4. Copy the key (shown once) and store it in your environment variables

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Development">
    
    For local development, use headers with your agent IDs:

    ```tsx
    import {
      InkeepChatButton,
      type InkeepChatButtonProps,
    } from "@inkeep/agents-ui";

    const buttonProps: InkeepChatButtonProps = {
      aiChatSettings: {
        agentUrl: "http://localhost:3003/api/chat",
        headers: {
          "x-inkeep-tenant-id": "your-tenant-id",
          "x-inkeep-project-id": "your-project-id",
          "x-inkeep-agent-id": "your-agent-id",
        },
      },
    };

    const ChatButton = () => {
      return <InkeepChatButton {...buttonProps} />;
    };
    ```

    **Note:** Run your API server with `ENVIRONMENT=development` to bypass authentication.
