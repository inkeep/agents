The MCP server allows you to talk to your agents through the Model Context Protocol.

## MCP Server Implementation

The MCP server is implemented in the `@inkeep/agents-run-api` library and provides a standard interface for agent communication.

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes one core tool:

### send-query-to-agent

Sends a query to your agent's default sub-agent. This tool:

- **Name**: `send-query-to-agent`
- **Description**: Dynamically generated based on your agent's name and description
- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (string): The query to send to the agent
- **Returns**: The agent's response as text content

**Example usage in Cursor:**
When the MCP server is configured, Cursor will automatically discover this tool and you can use it by asking questions. The tool will route your query to the appropriate sub-agent in your agent and return the response.

The tool handles:

- Message creation and conversation management
- Sub-agent execution with your configured tools and capabilities
- Context resolution if your agent has context configuration
- Error handling and response formatting

## Using with Cursor

### Manual Configuration

Add the following configuration to your Cursor MCP settings.

#### Example

Example when using an API key for auth:

```json
{
  "AgentName": {
    "type": "mcp",
    "url": "http://<your-run-api-url>/v1/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <agent_api_key>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Session Management (Required by MCP HTTP Transport)

- Initialize a session by sending an `initialize` JSON-RPC request to `/v1/mcp`.
- The server will respond and set `Mcp-Session-Id` in response headers.
- For all subsequent JSON-RPC requests in that session, include `Mcp-Session-Id` header with the value from initialization.

<Note>
  Session management is required by MCPâ€™s HTTP transport. If `Mcp-Session-Id` is missing or invalid on follow-up requests, the server will return a JSON-RPC error (e.g., "Session not found").
</Note>

## Configuration Notes

- **URL**: Point to your `agents-run-api` instance (default: `http://localhost:3003`)
- **Headers**: Use the appropriate authentication mode per the section above
- **Authorization**: Only required outside development mode
