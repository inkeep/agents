### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+ (installation instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation))

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents
cd my-agent-directory
```

### Step 2: Launch the development environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Visual Builder will open automatically at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 3: Chat with your agent

Navigate to the weather graph project that was automatically created, click into the weather graph, and then click the "Try It" button to start chatting with the agent.

Next, we recommend setting up observability to see live traces of your agent. See [Observability](/quick-start/observability) for more information.
