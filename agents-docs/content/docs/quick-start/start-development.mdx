---

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+ (installation instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation))

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agents 
cd my-agents
```

### Step 2: Launch the development environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Visual Builder will open automatically at http://localhost:3000.

#### Service Ports

The development environment starts multiple services on different ports:

| Service | Port | URL | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Visual Builder** | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 | Web interface for building and managing agents |
| **Manage API** | 3002 | http://localhost:3002 | API for managing agent configurations and projects |
| **Run API** | 3003 | http://localhost:3003 | API for executing agent conversations with your agents |

<Note>
Make sure these ports are available before starting the development environment. If any port is in use, you'll need to free it up first.
</Note>

### Step 3: Install the Inkeep CLI

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 4: Push your project

Running this command will push the code you defined your agents and tools with to the Visual Builder.

```bash
cd src/weather-project
inkeep push
```

### Step 5: Chat with your agent

Open the Visual Builder at http://localhost:3000, click into the weather graph, and then click the "Try It" button to start chatting with the agent.

Next, we recommend setting up observability to see live traces of your agent. See [Traces](/quick-start/traces) for more information.
