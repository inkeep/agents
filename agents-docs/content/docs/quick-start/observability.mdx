## Overview

You can set up SigNoz in two ways:

1.  **Cloud Setup**: Use SigNoz Cloud (recommended)
2. **Local Setup**: Run SigNoz locally using Docker

## Option 1: SigNoz Cloud Setup

### Step 1: Create SigNoz Cloud Account

1. Sign up at [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one
3. Note your ingestion endpoint and API key from the project settings

### Step 2: Configure Run API Environment

Navigate to your `run-api` directory under `apps` and create or update your `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenTelemetry Configuration for SigNoz Cloud
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```

### Step 3: Configure Root Environment

In your **root project directory**, update your `.env` file:

```bash
# SigNoz Cloud Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNOZ_URL=https://<your-organization>.signoz.cloud
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```


### Step 4: Verify Cloud Setup

1. Start your Inkeep agents:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Generate some traces by interacting with your agents

3. Open your SigNoz Cloud dashboard and navigate to "Traces" to see your agent traces

## Option 2: Local SigNoz Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

### Step 1: Clone the Optional Services Repository

Clone the Inkeep optional local development services repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agents-optional-local-dev
cd agents-optional-local-dev
```

### Step 2: Start SigNoz Services

Run the following command to start SigNoz and related services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:
- SigNoz frontend (accessible at `http://localhost:3080`)
- SigNoz query service
- SigNoz OTEL collector
- ClickHouse database

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your **root project directory** (of my-agent-directory), update your `.env` file:

```bash
# SigNoz Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNOZ_URL=http://localhost:3080
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=your-signoz-api-key
```

To get your SigNoz API key:

1. Open SigNoz at `http://localhost:3080`
2. Navigate to Settings → Account Settings → API Keys
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one

### Step 4: Verify Setup

1. Restart your Inkeep agents:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Make some requests to your agents to generate traces

3. Open SigNoz at `http://localhost:3080` and navigate to the "Traces" section to see your agent traces
