### Optional: Install pnpm

If you don't have pnpm yet, use Corepack:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    npm install -g corepack@latest    # Ensures Corepack is present & up-to-date
    corepack enable pnpm              # Installs pnpm shims on PATH
    corepack install -g pnpm@latest-10 # Sets PNPM 10 as the global default
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    npm install -g corepack@latest    # Ensures Corepack is present & up-to-date
    corepack enable pnpm              # Installs pnpm shims on PATH
    corepack install -g pnpm@latest-10 # Sets PNPM 10 as the global default
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    npm install -g corepack@latest    # Ensures Corepack is present & up-to-date
    corepack enable pnpm              # Installs pnpm shims on PATH
    corepack install -g pnpm@latest-10 # Sets PNPM 10 as the global default
    ```

    <Note>
      If PowerShell blocks pnpm.ps1 due to execution policy, use Command Prompt (cmd) or run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force`
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js 22+ installed (Latest LTS) for compatibility with PNPM 10 and our agent framework.
</Tip>

### Step 1: Create a new agents project

```bash
npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agent-directory
cd my-agent-directory
```

If used corepack for installing pnpm:
```
corepack use pnpm@latest-10  # pins pnpm version in package.json
```

### Step 2: Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Install the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 4: Push your first agent graph

```bash
cd src/my-project
inkeep push weather.graph.ts
```

### Step 5: Start the dashboard server

```bash
inkeep dev
```

### Step 6: Chat with your agent

Go to the project you created, and click into the weather graph. Then click the "Try It" button to begin a conversation with your agent.
