# Contributing to the Inkeep Agent Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agent Framework! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm package manager
- Docker Desktop (for certain features)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up the database
cd inkeep-chat
pnpm db:push
```

## Development Workflow

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky for Git hooks to maintain code quality. The hooks are automatically installed when you run `pnpm install`.

#### Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook runs the following checks before allowing a commit:

1. **Type checking** - Ensures type safety across all packages
2. **Tests** - Runs the test suite

##### Bypassing Checks

While we recommend running all checks, there are legitimate cases where you might need to bypass them:

**Skip typecheck only (tests still run):**

```bash
SKIP_TYPECHECK=1 git commit -m "WIP: debugging issue"
```

**Skip all hooks (use sparingly):**

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: hotfix for production"
```

> **Note:** Use these bypass mechanisms sparingly. They're intended for:
>
> - Work-in-progress commits that you'll fix before pushing
> - Emergency fixes where speed is critical
> - Commits that only touch non-code files (though hooks are smart enough to handle this)

### Code Quality

#### Type Checking

Run type checking across all packages:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

#### Linting

Run the linter:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Format code automatically:

```bash
pnpm format
```

#### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Building

Build all packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
cd inkeep-chat
pnpm dev
```

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed with Turborepo. Key packages include:

- `inkeep-chat/` - Main Agent Framework server
- `agent-builder/` - Builder SDK for declarative agent definitions
- `cli/` - Command-line interface
- `chat-widget/` - Web chat widget

## Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all checks pass (`pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`)
5. Commit your changes (following commit message guidelines)
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a pull request

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update tests for any behavior changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

## Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline runs on all pull requests and includes:

- Type checking (`pnpm typecheck`)
- Tests (`pnpm test`)
- Build verification (`pnpm build`)

These checks must pass before a PR can be merged. The same checks run in pre-commit hooks to catch issues early.

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please:

1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Open a new issue if your question isn't addressed
3. Reach out to the maintainers

Thank you for contributing!
