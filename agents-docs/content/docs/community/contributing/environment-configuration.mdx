# Environment Configuration

## Overview

The Inkeep Agents framework uses a **centralized environment configuration**. This approach provides a single source of truth for all environment variables across the monorepo, eliminating duplication and simplifying configuration management.

## Configuration Structure

### Single Root Configuration

All packages in the monorepo reference a **single `.env` file** at the repository root. This is different from the typical approach of having separate `.env` files per package.

```
agents-4/
├── .env                    # Main configuration (gitignored)
├── .env.example            # Template with all variables
└── packages/
    └── agents-core/
        └── src/env.ts      # Centralized env loader
```

### Loading Priority

Environment variables are loaded in the following order (highest priority first):
1. **`/package-name/.env`** Package specific configuration
2. **`.env`** - Main configuration file
3. **`~/.inkeep/config`** - User-global settings (shared across all repo copies)
4. **`.env.example`** - Default values

This hierarchy allows for flexible configuration management across different scenarios. If you have .env or .env.local in a package directory, they will override the root .env or .env.local for that package.

## Use Cases

### 1. Basic Local Development

For simple local development with a single repository copy:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
vim .env

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Environment variables not loading

1. Check loading order - later sources override earlier ones
2. Verify file paths are correct
3. Ensure `packages/agents-core` is built: `pnpm --filter @inkeep/agents-core build`

### Missing variables in production

Ensure all required variables are set in your deployment environment. The application will fail fast if critical variables are missing.

### Database connection issues

- For SQLite: Make sure youu are using an absolute path to the db file
