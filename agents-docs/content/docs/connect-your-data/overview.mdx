Connect your data sources to your agents through MCP servers. Support websites, GitHub repositories, documentation, knowledge bases, PDFs, and more. Your agents can search and access this content in real-time.

## How it works

1. **Set up your data source** - Configure your chosen provider and connect your data sources
2. **Get your MCP server URL** - Obtain the MCP server endpoint from your provider
3. **Register the MCP server** - Register it as a tool in the Visual Builder or TypeScript SDK
4. **Use in your agents** - Your agents can now search and access your connected data

## Choose a data provider

## Other options

Consider these additional options for connecting your data:

- **[Reducto](https://reducto.ai/)** - Self-serve document processing with a free tier. Upload documents and access them via APIs or SDKs. Wrap their APIs in your own MCP server or invoke them directly using [function tools](/typescript-sdk/tools/function-tools).

- **[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/)** - Document processing platform with a free tier. Upload documents and access them via APIs or SDKs. Wrap their APIs in your own MCP server or invoke them directly using [function tools](/typescript-sdk/tools/function-tools).

- **[Milvus](https://milvus.io/)** - Open-source vector database with self-hosting options. See their [MCP integration guide](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus_and_mcp.md) for setup instructions. Must manage deployment and hosting for MCP server.

- **[SingleStore](https://singlestore.com/)** - Relational database with a managed MCP server that converts natural language queries into SQL. Learn more in their [MCP server documentation](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/ai-services/singlestore-mcp-server/).
