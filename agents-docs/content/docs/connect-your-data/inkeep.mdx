## Getting started

### Step 1: Set up your Inkeep account

If you don't have an Inkeep account yet, you can:

- [Try Inkeep on your content](https://inkeep.com/demo) - Test Inkeep with your own content
- [Schedule a call](https://inkeep.com/schedule-demo) - Get personalized setup assistance

### Step 2: Connect your data sources

1. Log in to your Inkeep dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Sources" tab
3. Add and configure your desired data sources (websites, GitHub repos, Notion pages, etc.)
4. Wait for Inkeep to index your content

### Step 3: Get your MCP server URL

Once your data sources are connected and indexed, obtain your Inkeep MCP server URL from your Inkeep dashboard. This URL will be used to register the MCP server with your agents.

### Step 4: Register the MCP server

Register your Inkeep MCP server as a tool in your agent configuration:

**Using TypeScript SDK:**

```typescript
import { mcpTool, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const inkeepTool = mcpTool({
  id: "inkeep-knowledge-base",
  name: "knowledge_base",
  description: "Search the company knowledge base powered by Inkeep",
  serverUrl: "YOUR_INKEEP_MCP_SERVER_URL", // From your Inkeep dashboard
});

const supportAgent = subAgent({
  id: "support-agent",
  name: "Support Agent",
  description: "Answers questions using the company knowledge base",
  prompt: `You are a support agent with access to the company knowledge base.`,
  canUse: () => [inkeepTool],
});
```

**Using Visual Builder:**

1. Go to the **MCP Servers** tab in the Visual Builder
2. Click "New MCP server"
3. Select "Custom Server"
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Inkeep Knowledge Base`
   - **URL**: Your Inkeep MCP server URL
   - **Transport Type**: `Streamable HTTP`
5. Save the server
6. Add it to your agent by dragging it onto your agent canvas
