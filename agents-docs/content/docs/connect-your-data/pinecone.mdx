Pinecone is a vector database that allows you to store and query your data in a vector space. With Pinecone's MCP server, you can connect your documents and files to your agents, enabling semantic search and retrieval of your content.

## Supported data sources

With Pinecone you can connect:

- **Documents**: DOCX (.docx), PDF (.pdf), Text (.txt)
- **Structured Data**: JSON (.json)
- **Documentation**: Markdown (.md)

## Getting started

### Step 1: Create a Pinecone account

[Sign up for Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/)

### Step 2: Create an Assistant

1. Log in to your [Pinecone dashboard](https://app.pinecone.io/)
2. Navigate to the **Assistant** tab
3. Click **"Create an Assistant"**
4. Give your assistant a name

### Step 3: Upload your files

1. In your assistant, navigate to the **Files** tab (located in the top right corner)
2. Upload your documents (DOCX, JSON, Markdown, PDF, or Text files)
3. Wait for Pinecone to process and index your content

<Tip>
Test your assistant in the Assistant playground. Try uploading an Apple 10-K PDF file from [Apple's investor relations page](https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/default.aspx) and ask it to summarize the document.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Get your MCP server URL

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab in your assistant
2. Copy the MCP URL provided

### Step 5: Register the MCP server

Register the Pinecone MCP server as a tool in your agent configuration. Replace `<your-mcp-url>` with the MCP URL you copied in Step 4.

**Using TypeScript SDK:**

```typescript
import { mcpTool, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const pineconeTool = mcpTool({
  id: "pinecone-documents",
  name: "pinecone_search",
  description: "Search uploaded documents and files using semantic search",
  serverUrl: "<your-mcp-url>", // From Pinecone Settings tab
});

const docAgent = subAgent({
  id: "doc-agent",
  name: "Documentation Assistant",
  description: "Answers questions using uploaded documents",
  prompt: `You are a documentation assistant with access to company documents and files.`,
  canUse: () => [pineconeTool],
});
```

**Using Visual Builder:**

1. Go to the **MCP Servers** tab in the Visual Builder
2. Click **"New MCP server"**
3. Select **"Custom Server"**
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Pinecone Documents`
   - **URL**: Your MCP URL from Pinecone Settings tab
   - **Transport Type**: `Streamable HTTP`
5. Save the server
6. Add it to your agent by dragging it onto your agent canvas

**Using Visual Builder:**

1. Go to the **MCP Servers** tab in the Visual Builder
2. Click "New MCP server"
3. Select "Custom Server"
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Pinecone Documents`
   - **URL**: Your MCP URL from Pinecone Settings tab
   - **Transport Type**: `Streamable HTTP`
5. Save the server
6. Add it to your agent by dragging it onto your agent canvas

### Step 6: Use the Pinecone MCP server in your agent

Once you have registered your MCP server as a tool and connected it to your agent, your agent can use the Pinecone tool to search and retrieve relevant content from your uploaded documents.

The Pinecone tool provides a `get_context` function that retrieves relevant document snippets from your knowledge base. When your agent calls this tool, it will:

- **Search semantically**: Use vector similarity search to find the most relevant content based on the query
- **Return formatted snippets**: Each result includes:
  - `file_name`: The name of the file containing the snippet
  - `pages`: The page numbers where the snippet appears (for PDFs and DOCX files)
  - `content`: The actual text content of the snippet

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required): The search query to retrieve context for
- `top_k` (optional): The number of context snippets to retrieve. Defaults to 15.
