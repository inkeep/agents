Artifact components let agents save information from tool calls so it can be referenced later by the same agent or other agents in the graph.

## What Are Artifacts?

When an agent uses a tool (like web search), the tool returns information. Instead of losing this information after the response, artifacts save it for future use.

**Think of artifacts like bookmarks with content** - they store both a summary (for quick reference) and the full details (for deep analysis).

## Why Use Artifacts?

- **Share data between agents**: Research agent finds sources, writing agent uses them for citations
- **Reference tool results**: Keep search results, API responses, or file contents for later use  
- **Maintain sources**: Track where information came from for transparency

## Creating Artifact Components

### Step 1: Create the Component

1. Go to **Artifact Components** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New artifact component"**
3. Fill out the form:
   - **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `web-source`)
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., `Web Source`)
   - **Description**: What this artifact stores (e.g., `Information found from web searches`)

### Step 2: Define the Schema

You need to define two JSON schemas:

#### Summary Props (Required)
Quick info shown to agents - keep this simple:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Page title"
    },
    "url": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Page URL"
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "url"]
}
```

#### Full Props (Required)  
Complete details stored in database:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Full page content"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Author name"
    },
    "date": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Publication date"
    }
  },
  "required": ["content"]
}
```

### Step 3: Add to Graph

After creating the artifact component, add it to your agents:

1. Go to **Graphs** in the left sidebar
2. Edit your graph
3. Select your agents and add the artifact component
4. Save the graph

## Example: Research Sources

Here's a complete example for saving research sources:

**Artifact Component Settings:**
- **ID**: `research-source`
- **Name**: `Research Source`
- **Description**: `Sources found during research with citations`

**Summary Props:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": { "type": "string" },
    "url": { "type": "string" },
    "relevance": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "enum": ["high", "medium", "low"] 
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "url", "relevance"]
}
```

**Full Props:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "content": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Full article text" 
    },
    "key_points": { 
      "type": "array", 
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "description": "Main points from the article"
    },
    "author": { "type": "string" },
    "publication_date": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["content"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **User asks**: "Research renewable energy trends"

2. **Research agent**: 
   - Uses web search tool
   - Tool returns data matching your artifact schema
   - Artifact gets created automatically
   - Agent can reference it: "I found good information about solar panels [artifact-123]"

3. **Writing agent**: 
   - Sees the same artifacts in its context
   - Can use them in responses: "According to my research [artifact-123], solar adoption is increasing..."

## Automatic Naming

The framework automatically generates names and descriptions for artifacts using the agent's summarizer model. You don't need to manually name each artifact - they get descriptive names like "Solar Energy Adoption Study" based on their content.

## Key Points

- **Shared**: All agents in the graph can access the same artifacts
- **Automatic**: Created when tools return matching data
- **Traceable**: Every piece of information links back to its source
- **Persistent**: Saved for the entire conversation
