## How to create an artifact component

1. Go to the Artifact Components tab in the left sidebar. Then select "New artifact component".
2. Add in an id, name, and description. These are required fields.
3. For the props schema, you can either:
   - **Enter a JSON schema** with `inPreview: true` properties to define specific fields that will be immediately available
   - **Leave empty** to save the entire tool result without filtering
4. Click "Submit".

To visually add the artifact component to the Agent, see the [Sub Agents](/visual-builder/sub-agents#adding-artifact-components) page for details.

### Preview Fields

Set `inPreview: true` on properties for immediate availability. These fields are:
- Shown to other agents for reasoning
- Streamed in real-time to clients (Vercel AI SDK)
- Auto-rendered by Inkeep's widget (citations as interactive cards)
- Available immediately in UI (full artifact loads on-demand)

**Example:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": { "type": "string", "inPreview": true },
    "url": { "type": "string", "inPreview": true },
    "content": { "type": "array" }
  }
}
```

Citation artifacts with `title`, `url`, and `record_type` preview fields are auto-rendered as interactive cards by Inkeep's widget, providing source attribution.

<img
  src="/images/citation-widget-example.png"
  alt="Citation artifact rendered as an interactive card in the Inkeep widget showing source attribution"
  width="100%"
  style={{ borderRadius: "10px", marginTop: "1rem" }}
/>

## Artifact Name & Description Generation

**Important**: Artifact names and descriptions are automatically generated at the **agent level** using that specific agent's configured **summarizer model**.

### How It Works

When an agent creates an artifact during tool execution or data processing:

1. **Agent Creates Artifact**: During tool execution or data processing
2. **Summarizer Analysis**: The agent's summarizer model analyzes:
   - The artifact content and structure
   - Recent conversation context
   - The user's original question or request
3. **Name Generation**: Creates a concise, descriptive name (max 50 characters)
4. **Description Generation**: Provides context about relevance and content (max 150 characters)

### Model Settings for Artifacts

Each agent uses its configured summarizer model for artifact generation:

```typescript
// Agent with custom summarizer for artifact generation
const researchAgent = subAgent({
  id: "research-agent",
  name: "Research Agent",
  prompt: "You are a research agent that can generate artifact names and descriptions",
  models: {
    base: { model: "claude-sonnet-4" },
    summarizer: {
      model: "gpt-4.1-mini", // This model generates artifact names/descriptions
      providerOptions: {
        temperature: 0.2, // Lower temperature for consistent naming
        maxTokens: 512,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Inheritance and Fallback

Artifact generation follows the same model inheritance rules:

- **Default**: Sub Agent uses the Agent's summarizer model (if configured)
- **Fallback**: If no summarizer configured at project/agent level, falls back to Sub Agent's base model
- **Override**: Agent can specify its own summarizer model

### Best Practices

- **Consistent Models**: Use the same summarizer model across related agents for consistent artifact naming
- **Appropriate Models**: Choose models good at summarization (GPT-4o-mini, claude-3.5-haiku work well)
- **Temperature Settings**: Lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) provide more consistent naming patterns
