## Creating your first agent

<Video src="/videos/create-a-graph.mp4" />

1. Go to the Agents tab in the left sidebar. Then select "Create Agent".

2. After you create a new agent, it will start with a default sub agent. Add prompt to the sub agent, which is a mandatory field.

<Note>
  To delete a sub agent, click on the sub agent box and then hit the backspace key.
</Note>

The following are configurable options for the sub agent through the Visual Builder:

| Parameter             | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                | string | Yes      | Human-readable name for the sub agent                                                                                      |
| `description`         | string | No       | Brief description of the sub agent's purpose and capabilities                                                              |
| `prompt`              | string | Yes      | Detailed behavior guidelines and system prompt for the sub agent                                                           |
| `model`               | string | No       | AI model identifier (e.g., "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514") Choose a model that you prefer                        |
| `providerOptions`     | object | No       | Model-specific configuration options (temperature, maxTokens, etc.)                                                    |
| `Data components`     | object | No       | Data components that the sub agent can use. See [Data Components](/visual-builder/data-components) for details             |
| `Artifact components` | array  | No       | Artifact components that the sub agent can use. See [Artifact Components](/visual-builder/artifact-components) for details |

### Agent Prompt

You can configure an agent-level prompt that gets automatically added to all sub agents in your agent. This provides consistent context and behavior guidelines across your entire sub agent network.

**To add an agent prompt:**

1. Click on the agent settings/configuration area
2. Add your agent prompt in the "Agent Prompt" field
3. This prompt will be injected into each sub agent's system prompt

**Example uses:**

- Company-wide policies and tone guidelines
- Domain-specific context that applies to all sub agents
- Consistent behavior rules across the agent

## Trying the agent

To try the agent, first save the agent by clicking the "Save changes" button in the top right corner.

Then, click the "Try it" button in the top right corner and type into the chat input.

## Adding tools

Tools are used to perform actions in the agent. You can create MCP tools in the Visual Builder, see the [MCP Servers](/visual-builder/mcp-servers) page for more information.

Once you have a tool, add the tool to the agent by dragging and dropping the MCP tool box into the agent canvas.

To connect the tool to the sub agent, click on connector at the top of the MCP tool box, and then drag the connector to the sub agent. A line will appear, indicating that the tool is connected to the sub agent.

<Note>
  To delete a tool, click on the tool box and then hit the backspace key.
</Note>

## Adding sub agents

Sub agents are specialized sub agents that handle specific tasks within your agent's workflow. They allow you to delegate focused responsibilities to separate sub agents with their own prompt and capabilities.

To add a sub agent:

1. Drag and drop a sub agent box from the toolbar into the agent canvas
2. Configure the sub agent with its own prompt and settings
3. Connect it to the parent sub agent by clicking the connector at the top of the sub agent box and dragging it to the main sub agent

When connected, a line will appear showing the relationship between the sub agents.

## Adding data components

Data components are used to render rich UI components directly in the chat. Before adding a data component you will first need to create a data component, see the [Data Components](/visual-builder/data-components) page for more information.

Then, add the data component to your sub agent by clicking on the sub agent box, and then selecting which data components you want to add.

## Adding artifact components

To create artifact components, see the [Artifact Components](/visual-builder/artifact-components) page for details.

Add the artifact component to your sub agent by clicking on the sub agent box in the agent, then selecting which artifact components you want to add.

When the sub agent uses tools or delegates to other sub agents, artifacts will be automatically created according to your defined schema, capturing the source and content of each interaction.
