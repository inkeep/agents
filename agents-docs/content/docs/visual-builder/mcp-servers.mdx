## How to create an MCP server

1. Go to the MCP Servers tab in the left sidebar. Then select "New MCP server".
2. Add in a name, URL, and select the transport type. These are required fields.
3. Optionally, you can add an image URL to the MCP tool. If this MCP server requires authentication, you can add a credential. See the [Credentials](/visual-builder/credentials) for details on how to add a credential.
4. Click "Create server".

To visually add the MCP tool to the graph, see the [Graphs](/visual-builder/graphs#adding-tools) page for details.
