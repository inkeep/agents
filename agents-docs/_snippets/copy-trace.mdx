### Copy Trace for Debugging

The `Copy Trace` button in the timeline view allows you to export the entire conversation trace as JSON. This is particularly useful for offline analysis and debugging complex flows.

#### What's Included in the Trace Export

When you click `Copy Trace`, the system exports a JSON object containing:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "conversationId": "unique-conversation-id",
    "traceId": "distributed-trace-id",
    "agentId": "agent-identifier",
    "agentName": "Agent Name",
    "exportedAt": "2025-10-14T12:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "timing": {
    "startTime": "2025-10-14T11:59:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2025-10-14T12:00:00.000Z",
    "durationMs": 60000
  },
  "timeline": [
    // Array of all activities with complete details:
    // - Agent messages and responses
    // - Tool calls and results
    // - Agent transfers
    // - Artifact information
    // - Execution context
  ]
}
```

#### How to Use Copy Trace

1. Navigate to the **Traces** section in the management UI
2. Open the conversation you want to debug
3. Click the **Copy Trace** button at the top of the timeline
4. The complete trace JSON is copied to your clipboard
5. Paste it into your preferred tool for analysis

This exported trace contains all the activities shown in the timeline, making it easy to share complete execution context with team members or support.
