<Warning>
**User-scoped MCP servers are not supported with triggers.** Webhook triggers do not have user context, so the framework cannot determine which user's credentials to use. Use only project-scoped MCP servers with trigger-invoked agents. See [User vs Project MCPs](/deployment/inkeep-cloud/user-vs-project-mcp) for more details.
</Warning>
