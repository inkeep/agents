Artifacts are structured components that capture and store source information when agents interact with tools or other agents. They act as a record-keeping system, automatically documenting where information comes from during tool and agent interactions.

## How Artifacts Work

When an agent uses a tool (whether that's another agent or a utility tool), the response is automatically parsed to create artifacts. These artifacts store:
- The source of the information (tool/agent used)
- The relevant content from the response
- Metadata about the interaction

## Oversized Artifacts

When tool results exceed **30% of the model's context window**, they're marked as **oversized** to prevent context overflow.

**What happens:**
- ✅ Full data is saved to the database
- ❌ Retrieval is blocked to preserve context space
- ⚠️ Visual warnings appear in the UI traces panel

**UI Indicators:**
- Amber warning badge in timeline: `⚠️ Oversized artifact (~247K tokens)`
- Detailed warning in expanded view with size and percentage of context

**Tracing Attributes:**
- `artifact.is_oversized` - Boolean flag
- `artifact.retrieval_blocked` - Whether retrieval is blocked
- `artifact.original_token_size` - Estimated token count
- `artifact.context_window_size` - Model's context limit

**Troubleshooting:**
If seeing many oversized artifacts, consider:
- Filter tool outputs to return only necessary fields
- Paginate large result sets
- Pre-summarize responses in tools
- Use models with larger context windows
