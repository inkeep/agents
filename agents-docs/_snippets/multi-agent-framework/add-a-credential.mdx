Make sure your Visual Builder is running (if you haven't set it up yet, see [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start)). Navigate to the Credentials tab in the left sidebar and click "Create credential".

| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `Name`                    | A descriptive name for your credential (e.g., "production-api-key") |
| `API key`                 | The authentication token or API key for the service |

2. Optionally, configure additional settings:

| Field                     | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `Metadata`                | Additional headers to include with authentication requests (e.g., User-Agent, X-API-Key). Only available for Nango Store. |
| `Credential store`        | Where to securely store the credential. Choose from available stores ([Nango Store](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#nango-store) or [Keychain Store](/typescript-sdk/tools/credentials#keychain-store)) |
| `Link to MCP server`      | Optionally associate this credential with a specific MCP server that does not have a credential configured |

3. Click "Create Credential" to save the credential.
