To use MCP servers with your agents, you can:
- **Connect to Native MCP servers** from providers like Atlassian, Linear, Notion, and more
- **Use Composio's platform** for access to 10,000+ out-of-box MCP servers
- **Use Gram** to easily convert existing OpenAPI APIs into MCP Servers 
- **Build Custom MCP servers** for totally custom MCP servers

See the [MCP Servers tutorial](/tutorials/mcp-servers/overview) for details on all recommended approaches.

Once you have access to an MCP server, you can register it with your agents.
