To use MCP servers with your agents, you can:
- **Connect to Native MCP servers** from providers like Atlassian, Linear, Notion, and more
- **Use Composio's platform** for access to 10,000+ integrations
- **Build Custom MCP servers** for your own APIs and business logic

See the [MCP Servers tutorial](/tutorials/mcp-servers/overview) for details on all three approaches.

Once you have access to an MCP server, you can register it with your agents.
