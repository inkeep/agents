## Authentication (Run API Modes)

Start with the simplest option: a Standard API Key scoped to your graph.

### Quick start (Recommended)

- **Use a Standard API Key** created in the Visual Builder Dashboard
- **Header:** `Authorization: Bearer <graph_api_key>`
- **No other headers required** (tenant/project/graph are encoded in the key)

Steps in the UI:
1. Open the Visual Builder Dashboard
2. Go to your Project → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create**, select the target agent graph
4. Copy the API key (it will be shown once) and store it securely

See Authentication → Run API for more details.
