## Authentication (Run API Modes)

To start, create an API Key scoped to your graph.

### Create API key

Steps in the UI:
1. Open the Visual Builder Dashboard
2. Go to your Project â†’ **API Keys**
3. Click **Create**, select the target agent graph
4. Copy the API key (it will be shown once) and store it securely

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Advanced: Global Bypass Secret">

The global bypass secret allows internal services to authenticate without per-graph API keys.

**Configuration:**
- Set `INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_BYPASS_SECRET` environment variable on the Run API server

**When to use:**
- Internal services that need to access multiple graphs
- Staging/testing environments
- Automation tools that manage multiple graphs

**Headers required:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer <bypass_secret>
x-inkeep-tenant-id: <tenant-id>
x-inkeep-project-id: <project-id>
x-inkeep-graph-id: <graph-id>
```

**Note:** The bypass secret must match the environment variable exactly. All scope headers are required to identify which graph to execute.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced: Development Mode">

Development mode disables authentication entirely for local development.

**Configuration:**
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=development` on the Run API server

**Headers required:**
```http
x-inkeep-tenant-id: <tenant-id>
x-inkeep-project-id: <project-id>
x-inkeep-graph-id: <graph-id>
```

**Warning:** Never use development mode in production. It bypasses all authentication checks.
