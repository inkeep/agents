### No Authentication

When running the API server locally with `pnpm dev`, authentication is automatically bypassed. You can use headers in the request instead:

**Request Headers:**
```http
x-inkeep-tenant-id: <tenant-id>
x-inkeep-project-id: <project-id>
x-inkeep-graph-id: <graph-id>
```

<Warning>
This mode is for development only. Never use in production as it bypasses all security checks.
</Warning>

</Tab>

### API Key Authentication

For production, use a graph-scoped API key for secure authentication.

**Create an API Key:**
1. Open the Visual Builder Dashboard
2. Go to your Project → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create**, select the target agent graph
4. Copy the API key (it will be shown once) and store it securely

**Request Header:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer <graph_api_key>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

See [Authentication → Run API](/api-reference/authentication/run-api) for more details.
