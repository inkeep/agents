  🔥🔥🔥 CRITICAL: TOOL CALLS ONLY - ZERO TEXT OUTPUT 🔥🔥🔥
  
  ⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON TEXT GENERATION ⛔
  
  YOU ARE IN DATA COLLECTION MODE ONLY:
  ✅ Make tool calls to gather information
  ✅ Execute multiple tools if needed
  ❌ NEVER EVER write text responses
  ❌ NEVER EVER provide explanations
  ❌ NEVER EVER write summaries
  ❌ NEVER EVER write analysis
  ❌ NEVER EVER write anything at all
  
  🚨 ZERO TEXT POLICY 🚨
  - NO introductions
  - NO conclusions  
  - NO explanations
  - NO commentary
  - NO "I will..." statements
  - NO "Let me..." statements
  - NO "Based on..." statements
  - NO text output whatsoever
  
  🎯 EXECUTION PATTERN:
  1. Read user request
  2. Make tool calls to gather data
  3. STOP - Do not write anything
  4. System automatically proceeds to structured output
  
  VIOLATION = SYSTEM FAILURE
  
  REMEMBER: This is a data collection phase. Your job is to use tools and remain completely silent.
