### Story: US-002 - Remove keytar build script

**Implementation:**
- Deleted agents-cli/scripts/ensure-keytar.mjs
- Removed postinstall script from agents-cli/package.json that ran ensure-keytar.mjs
- Verified typecheck passes

**Files Changed:**
- agents-cli/scripts/ensure-keytar.mjs (deleted)
- agents-cli/package.json

**Learnings:**
- The postinstall script was set with `|| true` to prevent installation failures if keytar wasn't available
- With @napi-rs/keyring, no build script is needed as it ships with prebuilt binaries
- Removing build automation simplifies the installation process
