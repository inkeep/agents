name: Deploy to Vercel Production

# This workflow deploys to Vercel production only when a GitHub release is published.
# It uses Vercel's deployment checks to verify API health before promoting to production:
# 1. Deploy to a preview URL (not production)
# 2. Wait for Vercel deployment checks to pass (configured in Vercel dashboard)
# 3. Promote the verified deployment to production
#
# Required secrets (configure in GitHub Repository Settings > Secrets):
# - VERCEL_TOKEN: API token from Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Tokens
# - VERCEL_ORG_ID: Organization/team ID from .vercel/project.json after running `vercel link`
# - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: Project ID from .vercel/project.json after running `vercel link`
