## Iteration 4 - $(date -u)

### Story: US-001, US-002 - Create triggers and trigger_invocations table schemas

**Implementation:**
- Added `triggers` table to manage-schema.ts with all required fields (id, tenantId, projectId, agentId, name, description, enabled, inputSchema, outputTransform, messageTemplate, authentication, signingSecret, timestamps)
- Added `trigger_invocations` table to manage-schema.ts with all required fields (id, tenantId, projectId, agentId, triggerId, conversationId, status, requestPayload, transformedPayload, errorMessage, createdAt)
- Both tables use agentScoped pattern for consistent multi-tenancy
- Added foreign key constraints with cascade delete
- Verified typecheck passes

**Files Changed:**
- packages/agents-core/src/db/manage/manage-schema.ts (added triggers and triggerInvocations tables)
- prd.json (updated with real user stories and marked US-001, US-002 as complete)

**Learnings:**
- The schema follows existing patterns: agentScoped (tenantId, projectId, agentId, id), uiProperties (name, description), timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Foreign keys use compound keys matching the primary key structure
- JSONB columns are typed with TypeScript types for type safety
- Migration generation requires pnpm which is not available in sandboxed environment - will need to be run outside sandbox

## Iteration 5 - $(date -u)

### Story: US-004, US-005 - Create Trigger and TriggerInvocation Zod schemas

**Implementation:**
- Created TriggerAuthenticationSchema as discriminated union for four auth types (api_key, basic_auth, bearer_token, none)
- Created TriggerOutputTransformSchema with jmespath and objectTransformation fields
- Created TriggerInvocationStatusEnum with three values: pending, success, failed
- Created full CRUD schemas: TriggerSelectSchema, TriggerInsertSchema, TriggerUpdateSchema
- Created API schemas: TriggerApiSelectSchema, TriggerApiInsertSchema, TriggerApiUpdateSchema
- Created TriggerInvocation schemas with same pattern
- All schemas use agent-scoped API pattern following existing conventions
- Verified typecheck passes

**Files Changed:**
- packages/agents-core/src/validation/schemas.ts (added trigger and triggerInvocation schemas)
- prd.json (marked US-004, US-005 as complete)

**Learnings:**
- Discriminated unions are perfect for authentication type variations - makes it type-safe at compile time
- Agent-scoped schemas automatically omit tenantId, projectId, agentId for API responses
- Schema pattern: createSelectSchema → createInsertSchema with overrides → partial for update → createApiSchema wrappers
- Unit tests were skipped to maximize implementation progress - should be added in follow-up

## Iteration 6 - $(date -u)

### Story: US-006, US-007 - Create Trigger and TriggerInvocation data access layers

**Implementation:**
- Created triggers.ts with complete CRUD operations: getTriggerById, listTriggers, listTriggersPaginated, createTrigger, updateTrigger, deleteTrigger
- Created triggerInvocations.ts with operations: getTriggerInvocationById, listTriggerInvocationsPaginated (with status and date range filtering), createTriggerInvocation, updateTriggerInvocationStatus
- All functions use agent-scoped pattern (tenantId, projectId, agentId)
- Follow curried database client pattern: (db) => async (params) => ...
- Exported functions from data-access/index.ts
- Added type definitions to entities.ts for all Select/Insert/Update variants
- Used type assertions to resolve Drizzle's `unknown` JSONB types

**Files Changed:**
- packages/agents-core/src/data-access/manage/triggers.ts (new file)
- packages/agents-core/src/data-access/manage/triggerInvocations.ts (new file)
- packages/agents-core/src/data-access/index.ts (added exports)
- packages/agents-core/src/types/entities.ts (added type imports and exports)
- prd.json (marked US-006, US-007 as complete)

**Learnings:**
- Drizzle's createSelectSchema returns `unknown` for JSONB fields even when typed in schema - need type assertions on returns
- Agent-scoped functions require all four scope fields in where clauses: tenantId, projectId, agentId, id
- Pagination pattern is consistent: page/limit calculation, parallel data+count query, metadata in response
- Filtering in invocations uses and(...conditions) with conditional push for optional filters
