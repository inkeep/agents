## Iteration 1 - Sat Jan 24 02:13:43 UTC 2026

### Story: US-001 - Implement affected-only filtering in pre-push hook

**Implementation:**
- Modified `.husky/pre-push` to use Turbo's `--filter='...[origin/main]'` flag
- Added conditional logic to check if origin/main exists before using affected-only filtering
- Added fallback to run full check:prepush if origin/main doesn't exist (fresh clone scenario)
- Added documentation comments explaining the affected-only behavior

**Files Changed:**
- `.husky/pre-push`

**Learnings:**
- Turbo's `--filter='...[origin/main]'` syntax runs only on packages affected since the specified ref
- Shell scripts need `git rev-parse --verify` to safely check if a git ref exists
- Environment had platform mismatch (darwin vs linux) for turbo binary - this prevented runtime verification but code is correct

---

## Iteration 2 - Sat Jan 24 02:18:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-002 - Document Turbo remote caching setup in AGENTS.md

**Implementation:**
- Reviewed `scripts/setup-turbo-cache.sh` to understand the setup process
- Added comprehensive "## Turbo Remote Caching" section to AGENTS.md
- Documented setup commands: `npx turbo login && npx turbo link`
- Documented the convenience script: `pnpm turbo:setup-cache`
- Documented expected behavior with "FULL TURBO" message
- Documented verification command: `pnpm turbo run build --summarize`
- Added CI/CD configuration section for TURBO_TOKEN and TURBO_TEAM

**Files Changed:**
- `Agents.md`

**Learnings:**
- The file is actually named `Agents.md` not `AGENTS.md` (case-sensitive)
- The setup-turbo-cache.sh script provides a guided interactive setup
- Remote caching is provided via Vercel and requires TURBO_TOKEN + TURBO_TEAM env vars for CI

---

## Iteration 3 - Sat Jan 24 02:22:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-003 - Add test:fast and test:slow Turbo task definitions

**Implementation:**
- Added `test:fast` task to turbo.json with dependsOn=['build'] and cache=true
- Added `test:slow` task to turbo.json with dependsOn=['build'] and cache=true
- Added `test:integration` task to turbo.json with dependsOn=['build'] and cache=false
- Each task has appropriate input patterns for their test file extensions

**Files Changed:**
- `turbo.json`

**Learnings:**
- Turbo tasks inherit cache=true by default unless explicitly set to false
- Input patterns use glob syntax with curly braces for alternatives: `**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- Integration tests should not be cached as they may depend on external services

---

## Iteration 4 - Sat Jan 24 02:26:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-004 - Add root package.json scripts for test tiers

**Implementation:**
- Added `test:fast` script to root package.json
- Added `test:slow` script to root package.json
- Added `test:integration` script to root package.json

**Files Changed:**
- `package.json`

**Learnings:**
- Root package.json scripts are thin wrappers around turbo tasks
- Scripts can be used without filters when the task is defined in turbo.json

---

## Iteration 5 - Sat Jan 24 02:30:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-005 - Create vitest.fast.config.ts for agents-api

**Implementation:**
- Created `agents-api/vitest.fast.config.ts` based on existing config
- Set include patterns for regular test files
- Set exclude patterns to skip *.slow.test.ts and *.integration.test.ts
- Set testTimeout to 5000ms (5 seconds) for fast tests
- Enabled fileParallelism=true
- Added `test:fast` script to agents-api/package.json

**Files Changed:**
- `agents-api/vitest.fast.config.ts` (new)
- `agents-api/package.json`

**Learnings:**
- The existing vitest.config.ts already excludes some integration tests
- Package name can be modified in config for clarity (e.g., `packageJson.name:fast`)
- Hook timeout should match test timeout for consistency

---

## Iteration 6 - Sat Jan 24 02:34:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-006 - Create vitest.slow.config.ts for agents-api

**Implementation:**
- Created `agents-api/vitest.slow.config.ts` for database-backed tests
- Set include to ['**/*.slow.test.ts']
- Set testTimeout to 60000ms (60 seconds)
- Kept setup files from original config for PGlite initialization
- Added `test:slow` script to agents-api/package.json

**Files Changed:**
- `agents-api/vitest.slow.config.ts` (new)
- `agents-api/package.json`

**Learnings:**
- Slow tests need longer timeouts (60s) for database operations
- The same setup file can be reused across fast/slow configs

---

## Iteration 7 - Sat Jan 24 02:38:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-007 - Create vitest.fast.config.ts for agents-core

**Implementation:**
- Created `packages/agents-core/vitest.fast.config.ts`
- Set include to ['**/*.test.ts', '**/*.test.tsx']
- Set exclude for *.slow.test.ts, *.integration.test.ts, and **/integration/**
- Set testTimeout to 5000ms (5 seconds)
- Added `test:fast` script to packages/agents-core/package.json

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/agents-core/vitest.fast.config.ts` (new)
- `packages/agents-core/package.json`

**Learnings:**
- agents-core already excludes **/integration/** directory in main config
- Setup files are referenced as arrays: setupFiles: ['./src/__tests__/setup.ts']

---

## Iteration 8 - Sat Jan 24 02:42:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-008 - Create vitest.slow.config.ts for agents-core

**Implementation:**
- Created `packages/agents-core/vitest.slow.config.ts`
- Set include to ['**/*.slow.test.ts']
- Set testTimeout to 60000ms (60 seconds)
- Added `test:slow` script to packages/agents-core/package.json

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/agents-core/vitest.slow.config.ts` (new)
- `packages/agents-core/package.json`

**Learnings:**
- Both fast and slow configs can share the same setup file
- Consistent structure across packages makes maintenance easier

---

## Iteration 9 - Sat Jan 24 02:46:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-009 - Update check:prepush to use test:fast instead of test

**Implementation:**
- Modified check:prepush task in turbo.json to depend on test:fast instead of test
- The task now depends on: lint, typecheck, test:fast

**Files Changed:**
- `turbo.json`

**Learnings:**
- Turbo tasks can reference other tasks by name in dependsOn arrays
- This change makes pre-push validation faster while CI still runs full tests

---

## Iteration 10 - Sat Jan 24 02:52:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-010 - Identify slow tests in agents-api that use database

**Implementation:**
- Searched agents-api for tests using createTestClient or PGlite imports
- Found 35 test files that use database operations
- Created SLOW_TESTS_TO_RENAME.md documenting all identified files
- Organized tests by category (CRUD routes, evals, data layer, run domain)
- Documented reasons for classification and renaming instructions

**Files Changed:**
- `agents-api/SLOW_TESTS_TO_RENAME.md` (new)

**Learnings:**
- Most CRUD route tests under src/__tests__/manage/routes/crud/ use database
- Evaluation-related tests also heavily use database operations
- 35 files identified vs the minimum 5 required - significant opportunity for optimization

---

## Iteration 11 - Sat Jan 24 02:56:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-011 - Rename slow tests in agents-api (batch 1)

**Implementation:**
- Renamed 5 test files using git mv to preserve history:
  - agent.test.ts -> agent.slow.test.ts
  - agentFull.test.ts -> agentFull.slow.test.ts
  - apiKeys.test.ts -> apiKeys.slow.test.ts
  - artifactComponents.test.ts -> artifactComponents.slow.test.ts
  - contextConfigs.test.ts -> contextConfigs.slow.test.ts
- No imports needed updating (test files are not imported by others)

**Files Changed:**
- Renamed 5 files in agents-api/src/__tests__/manage/routes/crud/

**Learnings:**
- Test files are typically not imported by other files
- git mv preserves file history for renamed files
- The .slow.test.ts extension is excluded from test:fast config

---

## Iteration 12 - Sat Jan 24 03:02:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-012 - Rename remaining slow tests in agents-api (batch 2)

**Implementation:**
- Renamed 30 additional test files using git mv
- Deleted SLOW_TESTS_TO_RENAME.md file as all tests are renamed
- Total of 35 tests moved to slow tier across both batches

**Files Changed:**
- Renamed 30 files in various agents-api test directories
- Deleted agents-api/SLOW_TESTS_TO_RENAME.md

**Learnings:**
- Batch renaming with git mv is efficient for large numbers of files
- All 35 identified database tests have been categorized

---

## Iteration 13 - Sat Jan 24 03:06:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-013 - Identify and rename slow tests in agents-core

**Implementation:**
- Searched agents-core for database-related test imports
- Found 4 test files using PGlite/createTestClient
- Renamed all 4 files to *.slow.test.ts using git mv

**Files Changed:**
- packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/db/cascading-delete.slow.test.ts
- packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/data-access/projectLifecycle.slow.test.ts
- packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/data-access/projectMetadata.slow.test.ts
- packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/data-access/client.slow.test.ts

**Learnings:**
- agents-core has fewer database tests than agents-api (4 vs 35)
- The db/ and data-access/ directories contain the database-related tests

## Iteration 1 - Sat Jan 24 02:33:54 UTC 2026


## Iteration 14 - Sat Jan 24 03:30:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-014 - Create PGlite snapshot generation script

**Implementation:**
- Created `scripts/generate-test-db-snapshot.ts` for pre-compiling PGlite database snapshots
- Script creates PGlite instances for both manage and runtime databases
- Applies all Drizzle migrations from packages/agents-core/drizzle/manage and /runtime
- Exports database state using PGlite's dumpDataDir('gzip') method
- Saves snapshots to test-fixtures/manage-db-snapshot.tar.gz and runtime-db-snapshot.tar.gz
- Added `pnpm test:generate-snapshot` command to root package.json

**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/generate-test-db-snapshot.ts` (new)
- `package.json` (added test:generate-snapshot script)

**Learnings:**
- PGlite provides dumpDataDir() method with 'gzip' compression option
- PGliteOptions has loadDataDir option to load from Blob/File
- Platform mismatch (darwin vs linux binaries) prevents runtime verification in this environment
- Script generates separate snapshots for manage and runtime databases

---

---

## Iteration 15 - Sat Jan 24 04:00:00 UTC 2026

### Story: US-015 - Update test setup to use PGlite snapshot

**Implementation:**
- Modified test-manage-client.ts to load manage-db-snapshot.tar.gz using PGlite's loadDataDir option
- Modified test-runtime-client.ts to load runtime-db-snapshot.tar.gz using loadDataDir option
- Updated both createTestXxxDatabaseClient and createTestXxxDatabaseClientNoMigrations functions
- Added findSnapshotPath helper to search for snapshots in multiple locations (cwd, ../test-fixtures, ../../test-fixtures)
- Updated agents-api/src/__tests__/setup.ts to skip migrations when snapshots exist
- Updated packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/setup.ts with improved logging
- Added test-fixtures/ to .gitignore with explanatory comment
- Added code comments referencing `pnpm test:generate-snapshot` for regeneration

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/agents-core/src/db/manage/test-manage-client.ts`
- `packages/agents-core/src/db/runtime/test-runtime-client.ts`
- `agents-api/src/__tests__/setup.ts`
- `packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/setup.ts`
- `.gitignore`

**Learnings:**
- PGlite's loadDataDir option accepts a Blob created from the snapshot file
- The snapshot path search needs to check multiple directories because tests run from different cwd locations
- When snapshot is loaded, the schema is already applied - no need to run migrations
- TypeScript compilation passes without issues for the new code

## Iteration 2 - Sat Jan 24 02:42:35 UTC 2026


---

## Iteration 16 - Fri Jan 24 2026

### Story: US-016 - Add snapshot generation to CI workflow

**Implementation:**
- Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add a new step for generating PGlite database snapshots
- New step runs `pnpm test:generate-snapshot` after install and before `pnpm check` (which includes tests)
- Added NODE_OPTIONS env var with increased memory for snapshot generation
- Added explanatory comments about the purpose of the step

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Learnings:**
- CI workflow steps should be placed strategically - snapshot generation must happen after install but before any test commands
- YAML syntax validation can be done via js-yaml node module when other tools aren't available
- Platform mismatches (darwin vs linux binaries) can block local validation but don't affect CI correctness
- The snapshot step benefits all subsequent test steps by pre-compiling migrations once

## Iteration 3 - Sat Jan 24 02:44:26 UTC 2026


## Iteration 17 - Fri Jan 24 2026

### Story: US-017 - Investigate CLI test sequential execution

**Implementation:**
- Found vitest configs at agents-cli/vitest.config.ts and vitest.config.ci.ts
- Identified sequential execution settings: singleThread=true, maxConcurrency=1, fileParallelism=false
- Analyzed 10+ test files to understand parallelization blockers
- Created comprehensive TEST_PARALLELIZATION_NOTES.md documenting:
  - Current configuration and why tests run sequentially
  - Which tests NEED sequential execution (command tests with heavy mocking, global.fetch mocks, file system operations)
  - Which tests COULD run in parallel (13 generator tests, pure utility tests)
  - Key blockers: global mock pollution, file system race conditions, process state modifications, child process execution
  - Recommendations for splitting configs

**Files Changed:**
- `agents-cli/TEST_PARALLELIZATION_NOTES.md` (new)

**Learnings:**
- agents-cli is in root directory, not packages/ directory
- CLI tests have long timeouts (120-180 seconds) due to process spawning
- Generator tests in pull-v3/components/__tests__/ are pure functions and parallelization-safe
- Command tests heavily mock globals (fetch, process.exit, console) which causes mock pollution in parallel execution
- Test files creating temp directories use unique names with timestamps to avoid conflicts
