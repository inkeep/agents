## Iteration 1 - Wed Jan 21 08:04:38 UTC 2026

### Story: US-001 - Update package.json dependencies

**Implementation:**
- Removed keytar from packages/agents-core/package.json optionalDependencies
- Removed keytar from agents-cli/package.json dependencies
- Removed keytar from create-agents-template/package.json pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies
- Added @napi-rs/keyring ^1.2.0 to packages/agents-core optionalDependencies
- Added @napi-rs/keyring ^1.2.0 to agents-cli dependencies
- Verified typecheck passes in both packages/agents-core and agents-cli

**Files Changed:**
- packages/agents-core/package.json
- agents-cli/package.json
- create-agents-template/package.json

**Learnings:**
- The repository uses pnpm workspaces with workspace protocol (workspace:^)
- Network restrictions in the environment prevented running pnpm install, but existing node_modules were sufficient for typecheck validation
- TypeScript is available in package-specific node_modules (e.g., agents-cli/node_modules/.bin/tsc)
- The create-agents-template had keytar in pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies config, which also needed to be removed
