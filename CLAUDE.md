# CLAUDE.md

This repository uses **AGENTS.md** as the primary guide for AI coding agents.

**Please refer to [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for comprehensive documentation.**

AGENTS.md follows the emerging standard for AI coding agent guidance files, making this repository compatible with multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Amp, and others). See [agents.md](https://agents.md/) for more information about this standardization effort.
