# Inkeep Agents

Inkeep's multi-agent framework enables multiple specialized AI agents to collaborate and solve complex problems through a **graph-based architecture**. You can define networks of agents, each with unique prompt, tools, and purposes.

## Two ways to build your agents

1. **Visual Builder**: A no-code interface for designing and managing agent workflows, making complex agent systems accessible to non-technical teams.

2. **Typescript SDK**: A code-first approach for building and managing agent workflows, allowing you to build complex agent systems with full control over the code.

   ```javascript
    import { agent, agentGraph } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';

    const helloAgent = agent({
      id: 'hello-agent',
      name: 'Hello Agent',
      description: 'A basic agent',
      prompt:
        'You are a basic agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
    });

    export const graph = agentGraph({
      id: 'basic-graph',
      name: 'Basic Graph Example',
      description: 'A basic graph',
      defaultAgent: helloAgent,
      agents: () => [helloAgent],
    });
   ```

## Key Features

- **Agents**: Decision-making units defined by prompts and prompt that callÂ tools and coordinate across multiple agents.
- **Tools**: The capabilities that agents can invoke. Tools can be your own custom functions or you can leverage our pre-built MCP tools for common integrations.
- **Visual Builder**: A no-code interface for designing and managing agent workflows, making complex agent systems accessible to non-technical teams.
- **Sub-agents**: Specialized components within our multi-agent architecture that enable direct user communication through delegation and transfers. Transfers reduce latency by avoiding a central agent proxy.
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: Gain full visibility into every step of your agent workflows.

## Advanced Features

- **Data components**: UI elements agents can render in conversations (order lists, buttons, forms, etc.).
- **Context Fetchers**: A mechanism for dynamically retrieving and caching external data when agents need it.
- **Artifacts**: The structured information generated by an agent's or tool's work.

## Contributing to the Inkeep Agent Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agent Framework! Here are guidelines and information for contributors.

### Prerequisites

[Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)

### Clone this repo

- [Install GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)

### Getting Started with Local Dev

#### Quick Setup

Run the automated setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This will create your environment configuration files and set up the database.

#### Manual Setup

1. Create your environment configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Add your API keys to `.env`:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xyz789
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx  # Optional
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash 
pnpm install
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
pnpm --dir ./packages/agents-core db:push
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Environment Configuration

We use a **centralized environment configuration** pattern inspired by Cal.com. All packages reference a single `.env` file at the repository root. This eliminates duplication and simplifies configuration management.

**Configuration Priority** (highest to lowest):
1. `.env.local` - Repository-specific overrides
2. `~/.inkeep/config` - User-global settings (shared across multiple repo copies)
3. `.env` - Main configuration
4. `.env.example` - Default values

See the [Environment Configuration Guide](docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed information.

### Running the test suite

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will run the test suite in parallel and create in-memory databases for each test to create isolation.

### Testing with Sample Graph

Execute the sample graph build/test. Observe the output. Use the sample graph defintion as a basis for your own graph defintion:

```bash
cd agents-run-api 
pnpm exec tsx ../examples/basic.graph.ts
```
