# Inkeep Agents

Inkeep's multi-agent framework enables multiple specialized AI agents to collaborate and solve complex problems through a **graph-based architecture**. You can define networks of agents, each with unique prompt, tools, and purposes.

## Two ways to build your agents

1. **Visual Builder**: A no-code interface for designing and managing agent workflows, making complex agent systems accessible to non-technical teams.

2. **Typescript SDK**: A code-first approach for building and managing agent workflows, allowing you to build complex agent systems with full control over the code.

   ```javascript
    import { agent, agentGraph } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';

    const helloAgent = agent({
      id: 'hello-agent',
      name: 'Hello Agent',
      description: 'A basic agent',
      prompt:
        'You are a basic agent that just says hello. You only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
    });

    export const graph = agentGraph({
      id: 'basic-graph',
      name: 'Basic Graph Example',
      description: 'A basic graph',
      defaultAgent: helloAgent,
      agents: () => [helloAgent],
    });
   ```

## Key Features

- **Agents**: Decision-making units defined by prompts and prompt that callÂ tools and coordinate across multiple agents.
- **Tools**: The capabilities that agents can invoke. Tools can be your own custom functions or you can leverage our pre-built MCP tools for common integrations.
- **Visual Builder**: A no-code interface for designing and managing agent workflows, making complex agent systems accessible to non-technical teams.
- **Sub-agents**: Specialized components within our multi-agent architecture that enable direct user communication through delegation and transfers. Transfers reduce latency by avoiding a central agent proxy.
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: Gain full visibility into every step of your agent workflows.

## Advanced Features

- **Data components**: UI elements agents can render in conversations (order lists, buttons, forms, etc.).
- **Context Fetchers**: A mechanism for dynamically retrieving and caching external data when agents need it.
- **Artifacts**: The structured information generated by an agent's or tool's work.
