# Pre-push hook: Comprehensive but fast validation
# Target: < 30 seconds (with cache)
#
# Runs optimized checks:
# - Lint (all packages except docs/cookbook)
# - Typecheck (all packages except docs/cookbook)
# - Tests (only affected packages since origin/main)
#
# Excludes slow builds (agents-manage-ui, agents-docs) for speed
# Full validation still runs in CI
