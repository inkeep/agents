# pnpm check Profiling Results

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Total execution time (no cache)**: ~177 seconds (~3 minutes)

## Summary

Profiling performed with turbo cache disabled (`--force` flag) to get accurate baseline timings.

### Breakdown by Task

| Task | Duration | % of Total | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| **test** | 67.46s | 38% | ✓ Slowest |
| **build** | 54.91s | 31% | ✓ |
| **typecheck** | 53.21s | 30% | ✓ |
| **lint** | 1.66s | 1% | ✓ Fastest |

## Key Findings

### 1. Test is the Bottleneck
- **67.46 seconds** - 38% of total execution time
- Tests run across all packages with actual test execution
- Includes integration tests, unit tests, and setup/teardown

### 2. Build and Typecheck are Nearly Equal
- **Build**: 54.91s (31%)
- **Typecheck**: 53.21s (30%)
- Both are CPU-intensive operations
- Build includes:
  - TypeScript compilation
  - Bundle generation (tsup/vite)
  - Next.js builds for docs and UI packages

### 3. Lint is Very Fast
- **1.66 seconds** - negligible impact
- Biome is extremely fast compared to ESLint
- Well-suited for pre-commit hooks

## Build Errors Fixed

### Issues Resolved
1. **@inkeep/create-agents**: Missing type declarations were resolved by running `pnpm install`
2. **@inkeep/agents-docs**: Build interruptions resolved - now builds successfully

### Root Cause
- Dependencies were not fully installed
- Running `pnpm install` with confirmation resolved all missing type declarations

## Safeguards in Place

The following safeguards prevent build errors from reaching production:

### 1. Pre-push Hook (`.husky/pre-push`)
```bash
# Runs before each push
pnpm check
```
- Prevents broken code from being pushed
- Runs complete CI pipeline locally
- Can be skipped with `--no-verify` (use sparingly)

### 2. Lint-Staged (on commit)
```json
{
  "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}": "biome check --write",
  "agents-manage-api/**/*.{ts,tsx}": "pnpm test --passWithNoTests",
  "agents-run-api/**/*.{ts,tsx}": "pnpm test --passWithNoTests"
}
```
- Runs on every commit
- Auto-fixes formatting issues
- Runs tests for changed files in critical packages

### 3. CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
```yaml
# Runs on: push to main, all PRs
- pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- pnpm check
```
- Blocks merging if checks fail
- Uses same `pnpm check` command as local development
- Ensures consistency between local and CI

## Performance Optimization Opportunities

### Short-term Wins (implemented)
1. ✅ **Cache is Working**: With cache enabled, lint hits 100% cache (completes in <1s)
2. ✅ **Parallel Execution**: Turbo runs tasks in parallel where possible
3. ✅ **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuilds changed packages

### Potential Future Optimizations
1. **Test Splitting**: Run tests in parallel across multiple workers
   - Currently: Sequential test execution per package
   - Potential: Use `vitest --pool=threads` or CI matrix
   - Est. savings: 30-40% of test time

2. **Remote Caching**: Enable Turborepo remote cache
   - Share cache across team members
   - Speed up CI by reusing local build artifacts
   - Est. savings: 50-80% on repeat builds

3. **Selective Testing**: Only run tests for affected packages
   - Use `--filter=[origin/main]` to run tests only on changed code
   - Est. savings: Variable, depends on change scope

## Usage

### Run profiling scripts

```bash
# Detailed profiling with breakdown
node scripts/profile-check-detailed.mjs

# Simple timing comparison
node scripts/analyze-turbo-output.mjs

# With chrome trace output (for visualization)
node scripts/profile-check.mjs
# Upload turbo-profile.json to https://ui.perfetto.dev/
```

### All scripts now use `--force` flag to disable cache for accurate profiling

## Recommendations

### For Local Development
1. **First run after checkout**: ~177s (expected)
2. **Subsequent runs**: ~5-10s with cache hits
3. **When making changes**: Only affected packages rebuild

### For CI/CD
1. **Current setup is optimal**: Already uses caching effectively
2. **Consider remote cache**: For faster team-wide builds
3. **Monitor test time**: If tests grow beyond 2 minutes, consider splitting

### For Contributors
1. **Use pre-push hooks**: Let them catch issues before CI
2. **Trust the cache**: Don't use `--force` unless profiling
3. **Run `pnpm check` locally**: Matches CI exactly, catches issues early
