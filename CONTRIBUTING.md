# Contributing to Agent Framework

## Human contributors
- Full contribution guide: [https://docs.inkeep.com/community/contributing/overview](https://docs.inkeep.com/community/contributing/overview)
- We intentionally avoid duplicating coding rules here; use the docs above for end-to-end process details (issues, branches, PRs, release cadence).

## AI coding assistants / coding practices
- Our canonical coding standards and automation guidance live in `AGENTS.md`. This is the single source of truth for agent rules and best practices.
- Raw file reference (rendered by GitHub): https://github.com/inkeep/agents/blob/main/AGENTS.md

Anything not covered in `AGENTS.md` should be specific to human-only workflows (e.g., team communication, PR etiquette, roadmap context) and should be documented in the docs link above, not repeated here.
